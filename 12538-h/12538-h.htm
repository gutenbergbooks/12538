<h4>DUCLER--ST. GEORGES DE BOCHERVILLE--M. LANGLOIS.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Ducler, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>You will look in vain for Ducler in the <i>livre des postes</i>;
yet this little town, which is out of the common road of the
traveller, becomes an interesting station to the antiquary, it
being situated nearly mid-way between two of the most important
remains of ancient ecclesiastical architecture in
Normandy--the abbeys of St. Georges de Bocherville and of
Jumieges.--The accommodation afforded by the inns at
Bocherville and Jumieges, is but a poor substitute for the
hospitality of the suppressed abbeys; and, as even the antiquary
must eat and perhaps sleep, he who visits either St. George or the
holy Virgin, will do well to take his <i>fricandeau</i> and his
bed, at the place whence I am writing.</p>

<p>At a period when the right bank of the Seine from Harfleur to
Rouen displayed an almost uninterrupted line or monastic buildings,
Ducler also boasted of a convent<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, <a name="Page_2"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;2]</span></a>which must have been of some
importance, as early as the middle of the seventh
century.--King Childeric IInd, granted the forest of Jumieges
to the convent of the same name and that of St. Vandrille; and St.
Ouen was directed by the monarch to divide the endowment between
the two foundations. His award did not give satisfaction to St.
Philibert, the abbot of Jumieges, who maintained that his house had
not received a fair allotment. The proposition was stoutly resisted
by St. Lambert, abbot of St. Vandrille; and the dispute was at
length settled by the saints withdrawing their claims, and ceding
the surplus land to the abbey of Ducler. St. Denys was the patron
of this abbey; and to him also the present parochial church is
dedicated: it is of Norman architecture; the tower is surrounded by
a row of fantastic corbels; and a considerable quantity of painted
glass yet remains in the windows. The village itself (for it is
nothing more than a village, though honored by French geographers
with the name of a <i>bourg</i>), consists of a single row of
houses, placed immediately under the steep chalk cliff which
borders the Seine. The face of the cliff is also indented by
excavations, in which the poorer inhabitants dwell, almost like the
Troglodytes of old. The situation of Ducler, and that of the two
neighboring abbeys, is delightful in summer and in fine weather. In
winter it must be cold and cheerless; for, besides being close to a
river of so great breadth, it looks upon a flat marshy shore,
whence exhalations copiously arise. The view from our chamber
window this morning presented volumes of mist rolling on with the
stream. The tide was <a name="Page_3"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;3]</span></a>setting in fast downwards; and
the water glided along in silent rapidity, involved in clouds.</p>

<p>The village of Bocherville, or, as it is more commonly called,
of St. Georges, the place borrowing its name from the patron saint
of the abbey, lies, at the distance of about two leagues from
Rouen. The road is exceedingly pleasing. Every turning presents a
fresh view of the river; while, on looking back, the city itself is
added to the landscape; and, as we approach, the abbey-church is
seen towering upon the eminence which it commands.</p>

<p>The church of St. Georges de Bocherville, called in old charters
<i>de Baucherville</i>, and in Latin <i>de Balcheri</i> or
<i>Baucheri villa</i>, was built by Ralph de Tancarville, the
preceptor of the Conqueror in his youth, and his chamberlain in his
maturer age. The descendants of the founder were long the patrons
and advocates of the monastery. The Tancarvilles, names illustrious
in Norman, no less than in English, story, continued during many
centuries to regard it as under their particular protection: they
enriched it with their donations whilst alive, and they selected it
as the spot to contain their remains when they should be no
more.</p>

<p>The following portion of the charter, which puts us in
possession of the indisputable &aelig;ra of the erection of the
church, is preserved by Mabillon<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. It is the Conqueror <a name="Page_4"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;4]</span></a>who
speaks.--"Radulfus, meus magister, aul&aelig;que et
camer&aelig; princeps, instinctu divino tactus, ecclesiam
supradicti martyris Georgii, qu&aelig; erat parva, re-edificare a
<a name="Page_5"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;5]</span></a>fundamentis inchoavit, et ex
proprio in modum crucis consummavit."</p>

<p>The Monarch and his Queen condescended to gratify a faithful and
favorite servant, by endowing his establishment. The corpse of the
sovereign himself was also brought hither from St. Gervais, by the
monks and clergy, in solemn procession, before it was carried to
Caen<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> for interment.</p>

<p><a name="Page_6"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;6]</span></a></p>

<p>Ralph de Tancarville, however, was not fortunate in the
selection of the inmates whom he planted in his monastery. His son,
in the reign of Henry Ist, dismissed the canons for whom it was
first founded, and replaced them by a colony of monks from St.
Evroul. Ordericus Vitalis, himself of the fraternity of St. Evroul,
commemorates and of course praises the fact. Such changes are of
frequent occurrence in ecclesiastical history; and the apprehension
of being rejected from an opulent and well-endowed establishment,
may occasionally have contributed, by the warning example, to
correct the irregularities of other communities. A century later,
the abbot of St. Georges was compelled to appeal to the pope, in
consequence of an attempt on the part of his brethren at St.
Evroul, to degrade his convent into a mere cell, dependent upon
theirs.--The chronicle of the abbey is barren of events of
general interest; nor do its thirty-one abbots appear to have been
men of whom there was much more to be said, than that they arrived
at their dignity on such a year, and quitted it on such another. Of
the monks, we are told that, in the fifteenth century, though their
number was only eight, the dignitaries included, the daily task
allotted them was greater than would in any of the most rigid
establishments, in latter days, have been imposed upon forty
brethren in a week!</p>

<p>Inconsiderable as is the abbey, in an historical point of view,
the church of St. Georges de Bocherville is of singular importance,
inasmuch as it is one of the land-marks of Norman architecture.
William, in his charter, simply styles himself <i>Dux
Normannorum</i>; it therefore <a name="Page_7"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;7]</span></a>was granted a few years before
the conquest. The building has suffered little, either from the
hands of the destroyers, or of those who do still more mischief,
the repairers; and it is certainly at once the most genuine and the
most magnificent specimen of the circular style, now existing in
Upper Normandy.--The west front is wholly of the time of the
founder, with the exception of the upper portion of the towers that
flank it on either side. In these are windows of nearly the
earliest pointed style; and they are probably of the same date as
the chapter-house, which was built in the latter part of the
twelfth century. The effect of the front is imposing: its general
simplicity contrasts well with the rich ornaments of the arched
door-way, which is divided into five systems of mouldings, all
highly wrought, and presenting almost every pattern commonly found
in Norman buildings. A label encircles the whole, the inner edge of
which is indented into obtuse pyramids, erroneously called
lozenges. The capitals of the columns supporting the arch are
curiously sculptured: upon the second to the left, on entering, are
Adam and Eve, in the act of eating the forbidden fruit; upon the
opposite one, is represented the Flight into Egypt. Normandy does
not contain, I believe, a richer arch; but very many indeed are to
be seen in England, even in our village churches, superior in
decoration, though not, perhaps, in size; for this at St. Georges
is on a very large scale: on each side of it is a smaller blank
arch, with a single moulding and a single pillar. Two tiers of
circular-headed windows of equal size fill up the front.--The
rest of the exterior may <a name="Page_8"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;8]</span></a>be said to be precisely as it was
left by the original builders, excepting only the insertion of a
pointed window near the central tower.</p>

<p>The inside is at least equally free from modern alterations or
improvements. No other change whatever is to be traced in it than
such as were required to repair the injuries done it during the
religious wars; and these were wholly confined to a portion of the
roof, and of the upper part of the wall on the south side of the
nave. The groined roof, though posterior to the original date of
the building, is perhaps of the thirteenth century. The nave itself
terminates towards the east in a semi-circular apsis, according to
the custom of the times; and there, as well as at the opposite
extremity of the building, it has a double tier of windows, and has
columns more massy than those in the body of the church. The aisles
end in straight lines; but, within, a recess is made in the
thickness of the wall, for the purpose of admitting an altar. Both
the transepts are divided within the church, at a short distance
from their extremities, into two stories, by a vaulted roof of the
same height as the triforium.--M. Le Prevost, who has very
kindly communicated to me the principal part of these details, has
observed the same to be the case in some other contemporary
buildings in Normandy. On the eastern side of each transept is a
small chapel, ending, like the choir, in a semi-circular apsis,
which rises no higher than the top of the basement story. A cable
moulding runs round the walls of the whole church within.--You
and I, in our own country, have often joined in admiring the massy
grandeur <a name="Page_9"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;9]</span></a>of Norman architecture,
exemplified in the nave of Norwich cathedral: at St. Georges I was
still more impressed by the noble effect of semi-circular arcades,
seen as they are here on a still larger scale, and in their
primitive state, uninterrupted and undebased by subsequent
additions.</p>

<p>On closer examination, the barbarous style of the sculpture
forces itself upon the eye. Towards the western end of the building
the capitals are comparatively plain: they become more elaborate on
approaching the choir. Some of them are imitations or modifications
(and it may even be said beautiful ones) of the Grecian model; but
in general they are strangely grotesque. Many represent quadrupeds,
or dragons, or birds, and commonly with two bodies, and a single
head attached to any part rather than the neck. On others is seen
"the human form divine," here praying, there fighting; here
devouring, there in the act of being devoured; not uncommonly too
the men, if men they must be called, are disfigured by enormous
heads with great flapping ears, or loll out an endless length of
tongue.--One is almost led to conceive that Schedel, the
compiler of the <i>Nuremberg Chronicle</i>, had a set of Norman
capitals before his eyes, when he published his inimitable series
of monsters. His "homines cynocephali," and others with "aures tam
magnas ut totum corpus contegant," and those again whose under lips
serve them as coverlids, may all find their prototypes, or nearly
so, in the carvings of St. Georges.</p>

<p>The most curious sculptures, however, in the church, are two
square bas-reliefs, opposite to one another, <a name="Page_10"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;10]</span></a>upon the
spandrils of the arches, in the walls that divide the extremities
of the transepts into different stories<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. They are cut out of the
solid stone, in the same manner as the subjects on the block of a
wood-engraving: one of these tablets represents a prelate holding a
crosier in his left hand, while the two fore-fingers of the right
are elevated in the act of giving the blessing; the other contains
two knights on horseback, jousting at a tournament. They are armed
with lance and buckler, and each of them has his head covered with
a pointed helmet, which terminates below in a nasal, like the
figures upon the Bayeux tapestry.--This coincidence is
interesting, as deciding a point of some moment towards
establishing the antiquity of that celebrated relic, by setting it
beyond a doubt that such helmets were used anterior to the
conquest; for it is certain that these basso-relievos are coeval
with the building which contains them.</p>

<p>This church affords admirable subjects for the pencil. It should
be drawn in every part: all is entire; all original; the
corbel-stones that support the cornice on the exterior are perfect,
as well along the choir and nave, as upon the square central
steeple: each of the sides of this latter is ornamented with a
double tier of circular arches. The buttresses to the church are,
like those of the chapel of St. Julien, shallow and unbroken; and
they are ranged, as there, between the windows. At the east end
alone they take the shape of small semi-cylindrical columns of
disproportionate length.</p>

<p><a name="Page_11"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;11]</span></a></p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_26" id="plate_26">
</a><img src="images/plate_26.png" height="336" width="439" alt="Sculpture upon a capital in the Chapter-House at St. Georges" /></p>

<p>The monastic buildings, which were probably erected about the
year 1700, now serve as a manufactory. Between them and the church
is situated the chapter-house, which was built towards the end of
the twelfth century, at a period when the pointed architecture had
already begun to take place of the circular style. Its date is
supplied in the <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, where we read, that
Victor, the second abbot, "obiit long&aelig;vus dierum, idibus
Martii, seu XVIII calendas Aprilis, ante annum 1211; sepultusque
est sub tabulâ marmoreâ in capitulo quod erexerat."</p>

<p>We found it in a most ruinous and dilapidated state, yet
extremely curious; indeed not less so than the church. Its front to
the west exhibits a row of three semi-circular arches, with an
ornament on the archivolt altogether different from what I
recollect to have seen elsewhere<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. The inside corresponds in profuse
decoration with this entrance; but the arches in it are all
pointed. An entablature of beautiful workmanship is carried round
the whole building, which is now used as a mill: it was crowded
with dirty children belonging to the manufactory; and the confusion
which prevailed, was far from being favorable to the quiet
lucubrations of an antiquary. In no part of the church is the
sculpture equally curious; and it is very interesting to observe
the progress which this branch of the art had made in so short a
time. Two or three of the capitals to the arches in front, seem to
include one continued action, taken apparently from the history of
Joshua. Another capital, of which I send you a sketch from the
pencil of M. Le Prevost, is a great <a name="Page_12"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;12]</span></a>curiosity. The group which it
contains, is nearly a duplicate of the supposed statue of William
the Conqueror at Caen. In all probability it represents some
legendary story, though the subject is not satisfactorily
ascertained. Against the pillars that support these arches, were
affixed whole-length figures, or cariatides, in alto-relievo. Three
of them still remain, though much mutilated; two women and a man.
They hold in their hands labels, with inscriptions that fall down
to their feet in front. One of the females has her hair disposed in
long braided tresses, which reach on either side to her girdle. In
this respect, as well as in the style of the sculpture and costume,
there is a resemblance between these statues and those on the
portals at St. Denys and at Chartres, as well as those formerly on
that of St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s, at Paris, all which are
figured by Montfaucon in his <i>Monumens de la Monarchie
Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, and are supposed by him to be of the times of
the Merovingian or Carlovingian dynasty; but subsequent writers
have referred them to the eleventh or twelfth century.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_27"></a>
<img src="images/plate_27.png" height="526" width="340" alt="M. Langlois" /></p>

<p>It was in this chapter-house that M. Langlois<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> found,
among a heap of stones, a most interesting capital, that had
formerly been attached to a double column. By his <a name="Page_13"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;13]</span></a>kindness,
I inclose you two drawings of it. One of them shews it in its
entire form as a capital; the other exhibits the bas-relief carved
upon it<a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_08"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_08.png" height="372" width="388" alt="Bas-relief on capital" /></p>

<p>The various injuries sustained by the building, render it
impossible to ascertain the spot which this capital originally
occupied; but M. Le Prevost supposes that it belonged to some gate
of the cloister, which is now destroyed. A more curious series of
musical instruments is, <a name="Page_14"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;14]</span></a>perhaps, no where to be found;
and it is a subject upon which authors in general are peculiarly
unsatisfactory. I am told that, in an old French romance, the names
of upwards of twenty are enumerated, whose forms and nature are

sculptured sword, under which it was supposed that either Ralph de
Tancarville himself, the founder of the abbey, or his grandson,
William, lay interred. It is of the latter that the records of the
monastery tell, how, on the fifth day after he girded himself with
the military belt, he came to the church, and deposited his sword
upon the altar, and subsequently redeemed it by various donations,

Benedict.</i> III. p. 674, 675.--This charter was not among
the archives of the monastery; but I am informed by M. Le Prevost,
that several are still in existence, most of them granted by the
family of the founder, but some by Kings of England. One of the
latter is by Richard Coeur de Lion, and his seal of red wax still
remains appended to it, in fine preservation. The seal, on one
side, represents the king seated upon his throne, with a pointed
beard, having his crown on his head, and a sword in one hand, and
sceptre in the other: on the other side, he is on horseback, with
his head covered with a cylindrical helmet, surmounted with a very
remarkable crest, in the form of a fan: on his shield are plainly
distinguishable the three lions of England.--From among the
charters granted by the Tancarville family, M. Le Prevost has sent
me copies of two which have never yet been printed; but which
appear to deserve insertion here. One is from Lucy, daughter of
William de Tancarville, and grand-daughter of Ralph, the
chamberlain.--"Notum sit Ricardo de Vernon and Willelmo

probably the lady's own autograph, the following
sentence:--"Et precor vos qu&ograve;d ecclesia Sancti Georgii
non decrescatur in tempore vestro pro Dei amore et meo de
elemosinis patris mei neque de meis."--There is still farther
subjoined, in a different hand-writing, and in a much paler
ink:--"H&aelig;c omnia Ricardus de Vernon libenter
concessit."--The other charter was granted by William the
Younger, and details a curious custom occasionally observed in the
middle ages, in making donations:--</p>

will join with me, I trust, in thanks to M. Langlois, for his

contain a more ardent admirer of her antiquities, or one to whom
she is more indebted for investigating, drawing, and publishing
them. But, to the disgrace of Rouen, his labors are not rewarded.
All the obstacles, however opposed by the "durum, pauperies,
opprobium," have not been able to check his independent mind: he
holds on his course in the illustration of the true Norman remains;
and to any antiquary who visits this country, I can promise a great
pleasure in the examination of his port-folio.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><a name="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8">[8]</a> This
difficulty, in the present instance, has yielded to the extensive
researches of Mr. Douce, who has afforded assistance to me, which,
perhaps, no other antiquary could have bestowed. He has unravelled
all the mysteries of minstrelsy with his usual ability; and I give
the information in his own words, only observing that the numbers
begin from the left.--"No. 1 was called the <i>violl</i>,
corresponding with our <i>Viol de Gamba</i>. As this was a larger
violin, though the sculptor has not duly expressed its comparative
bulk, I conceive it was either used as a tenor or base, being
perfectly satisfied, in spite of certain doubts on the subject,
that counterpoint was known in the middle ages.--No. 2 is the
largest instrument of the kind that I have ever seen, and it seems
correctly given, from one part of it resting on the figure, No. 3,
to support it. Twiss mentions one that he saw sculptured on the
cathedral, at Toro, five feet long. The proper name of it is the
<i>rote</i>, so called from the internal wheel or cylinder, turned
by a winch, which caused the <i>bourdon</i>, whilst the performer
stopped the notes on the strings with his fingers. This instrument
has been very ignorantly termed a <i>vielle</i>, and yet continues
to be so called in France. It is the modern Savoyard
<i>hurdy-gurdy</i>, as we still more improperly term it; for the
hurdy-gurdy is quite a different instrument. In later times, the
<i>rote</i> appears to have lost its rank in concert, and was
called the <i>beggar's lyre</i>.--No. 4 is evidently the
<i>syrinx</i>, or <i>Pan's pipe</i>, which has been revived with so
much success in the streets of London.--Twiss shewed me one
forty years ago, that he got in the south of France, where they
were then very common.--No. 5 is an instrument for which I can
find no name, nor can I immediately call to memory any other
representation of it. It has some resemblance to the old Welsh
fiddle or <i>crowth</i>; but, as a bow is wanting, it must have
been played with the fingers; and I think the performer's left hand
in the sculpture does seem to be stopping the strings on the upper
part, or neck, a portion of which has been probably broken
off.--I suspect it to be the old <i>mandore</i>, whence the
more modern <i>mandolin</i>. The rotundity of the sounding-board
may warrant this conjecture.--No. 6 was called the
<i>psalterion</i>, and is of very great antiquity, (I mean as to
the middle ages).--Its form was very diversified, and
frequently triangular. It was played with a <i>plectrum</i>, which
the performer holds in his right hand.--No. 7 is the
<i>dulcimer</i>, which is very common in sculpture. This instrument
appears, as in the present case, to have been sometimes played with
the fingers only, and sometimes with a <i>plectrum</i>.--No. 8
is the real <i>vielle</i>, or <i>violin</i>, of very common
occurrence, and very ancient.--No. 9 is a female tumbler, or
<i>tomllesterre</i>, as Chaucer calls them. This profession, so far
as we can depend on ancient representation, appears to have
exclusively belonged to women.--No. 10. A <i>harp</i> played
with a <i>plectrum</i>, and, perhaps, also with the left hand
occasionally.--No. 11. The figure before the suspended
<i>bells</i> has had a hammer in each hand with which to strike
them, and the opposite, and last, person, who plays in concert with
him, has probably had a harp, as is the case in an ancient
manuscript psalter illumination that I have, prefixed to the psalm
<i>Exaltate Deo</i>.--I have seen these bells suspended (in
illumination to the above psalm) to a very elegant Gothic frame,
ascending like the upper part of a modern harp."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XV"></a>LETTER XV.</h2>

<h4>ABBEY OF JUMIEGES--ITS HISTORY--ARCHITECTURAL
DETAILS--TOMBS OF AGNES SOREL AND OF THE ENERVEZ.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Ducler, July</i>, 1818)</p>

<p>The country between Ducler and Jumieges is of much the same
character with that through which we had already travelled from
Rouen; the road sometimes coasting the Seine, and sometimes passing
through a well-wooded country, pleasantly intermingled with
corn-fields. In its general appearance, this district bears a near
resemblance to an English landscape; more so, indeed, than in any
other part of Normandy, where the features of the scenery are upon
a larger scale.</p>

<p>The lofty towers of the abbey of Jumieges are conspicuous from
afar: the stone of which they are built is peculiarly white; and at
a distance scarcely any signs of decay or dilapidation are visible.
On a nearer approach, however, the Vandalism of the modern French
appears in full activity. For the pitiful value of the materials,
this noble edifice is doomed to destruction. The arched roof is
beaten in; and the choir is nearly levelled with the ground. Two
cart-loads of wrought stones were carried away, while we were
there; and the workmen were busily employed in its demolition. The
greater part, too, of the mischief, appears recent: the fractures
of the walls are fresh and sharp; and the fresco-paintings are
unchanged.--Had the proud, abbatial structure but been <a
name="Page_18"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;18]</span></a>allowed to have existed as the
parochial church of the village, the edifice might have stood for
ages; but the French are miserably deficient in proper feeling; and
neither the historical recollections connected with Jumieges, nor
its importance as a monument of architectural antiquity, could
redeem it from their tasteless selfishness. In a few years, its
very ruins will have perished; and not a wreck will remain of this
ancient sanctuary of religion and of learning.</p>

<p>It was in the year 654 or 655, that St. Philibert, second abbot
of Rebais, in the diocese of Meaux, founded this monastery. He
selected the site upon which the present building stands, a
delightful situation, in a peninsula on the right bank of the
Seine. This peninsula, and the territory extending from Ducler to
Caudebec, had been granted to him for this purpose by Clovis IInd,
or, more properly speaking, by Bathilda, his queen; for the whole
administration of affairs was in reality under her guidance, though
the reins of state were nominally held by her feeble husband. The
territory<a name="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> had previously borne the name of
Jumieges, or, in Latin, Gemeticum, a term whose origin has puzzled
etymologists. Those who hold it disgraceful to be ever at a loss on
points of this nature, and who prefer displaying a learned to an
unlearned ignorance, derive Gemeticum, either from <i>gemitus</i>,
because, "pro suis offensis ill&igrave;c gemunt, qui in <a name="Page_19"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;19]</span></a>flammis
ultricibus non erunt gemituri;" or from <i>gemma</i>, conformably
to the following distich,--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Gemmeticum siquidem a gemmâ dixere priores;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Qu&ograve;d reliquis gemm&aelig;, pr&aelig;celleret instar
Eo&aelig;."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The ground upon which the abbey was erected was previously
occupied by an ancient encampment. The author of the Life of St.
Philibert, who mentions this circumstance, has also preserved a
description of the original church. These authentic accounts of
edifices of remote date, which frequently occur in hagiology, are
of great value in the history of the arts<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.--The bounty of the <a
name="Page_20"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;20]</span></a>queen
was well employed by the saint; and the cruciform church, with
chapels, and altars, and shrines, and oratories, on either side,
and with its high altar hallowed by relics, and decked out with
gold and silver and precious stones, shews how faithfully the
catholics, in their religious edifices of the present day, have
adhered to the models of the early, if not the primitive, ages of
the church.</p>

<p>Writers of the same period record two facts in relation to
Jumieges, which are of some interest as points of natural
history.--Vines were then commonly cultivated in this place
and neighborhood;--and fishes of so great a size, that we
cannot but suppose they must have been whales, frequently came up
the Seine, and were caught under the walls of the
monastery.--The growth of the vine is abundantly proved: it is
not only related by various monkish historians, one of whom, an
anonymous writer, quoted by Mabillon, in the <i>Acta Sanctorum
ordinis Sancti Benedicti</i>, says, speaking of Jumieges, "hinc
vinearum abundant botryones, qui in turgentibus gemmis lucentes
rutilant in Falernis;" but even a charter <a name="Page_21"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;21]</span></a>of so late a date as the
year 1472, expressly terms a large tract of land belonging to the
convent, the vineyard<a name="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.--The existence of the
English monastic vineyards has been much controverted, but not
conclusively. Whether these instances of the northern growth of the
vine, as a wine-making plant, do or do not bear upon the question
of the supposed refrigeration of our climate by the increase of the
Polar ice, must be left to the determination of others.--The
whale-fishery of Jumieges rests upon the single authority of the
<i>Gesta Sancti Philiberti</i>: the author admits, indeed, that it
is a strange thing, "et a s&aelig;culo inauditum;" but still he
speaks of it as a fact that has fallen under his own knowledge,
that the monks, by means of hooks, nets, and boats, catch
sea-fish<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>, fifty feet in length, which at
once supply their table with food, and their lamps with oil.</p>

<p><a name="Page_22"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;22]</span></a></p>

<p>The number of holy men who originally accompanied St. Philibert
to his new abbey, was only seventy; but they increased with
surprising rapidity; insomuch, that his successor, St. Aicadras,
who received the pastoral staff, after a lapse of little more than
thirty years from the foundation of Jumieges, found himself at the
head of nine hundred monks, besides fifteen hundred attendants and
dependants of various denominations.</p>

<p>During all these early ages, the monastery of Jumieges continued
to be accounted one of the most celebrated religious houses in
France. Its abbots are repeatedly mentioned in history, as enjoying
the confidence of sovereigns, and as charged with important
missions. In their number, was Hugh, grandson of P&eacute;pin le
Bref, or, according to other writers, of Charlemagne. Here also,
Tassilo, Duke of Bavaria, and his son, Theodo, were compelled to
immure themselves, after the emperor had deposed them; whilst
Anstruda, daughter of Tassilo, was doomed to share his imperial
bed.</p>

<p>An &aelig;ra of misfortune began with the arrival of the
Normans. It was in May, in the year 841, that these dreadful
invaders first penetrated as far as Rouen, marking their track by
devastation. On their retreat, which almost immediately succeeded,
they set fire to Jumieges, as well as to the capital. In their
second invasion, under Ironside and Hastings, the "fury of the
Normans" was poured out upon Neustria; and, during their inroad,
they levelled Jumieges with the ground<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a
href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. But the monks <a name="Page_23"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;23]</span></a>saved
themselves: they dispersed: one fled as far as St. Gall; others
found shelter in the royal abbey of St. Denis; the greater part
re-assembled in a domain of their own, called Haspres, in Flanders,
whither they carried with them the bodies of St. Aicadrus and St.
Hugh: there too they resided till the conversion of their enemies
to Christianity.</p>

<p>The victorious fleet of Rollo first sailed in triumph up the
Seine, in the year 876. According to three monkish historians, Dudo
of St. Quintin, William of Jumieges, and Matthew of Westminster,
the chieftain venerated the sanctity of Jumieges, and deposited in
the chapel of St. Vast, the corpse of the holy virgin, Hameltruda,
whom he had brought from Britain. They also tell us that, on the
sixth day after his baptism, he made a donation of some lands to
this monastery.--The details, however, of the circumstances
connected with the first, diminish its credibility; and Jumieges,
then desolate, could scarcely contain a community capable of
accepting the donation. <a name="Page_24"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;24]</span></a>But under the reign of the son
and successor of Rollo, the abbey of Jumieges once more rose from
its ashes. Baldwin and Gundwin, two of the monks who had fled to
Haspres, returned to explore the ruins of the abbey: they
determined to seclude themselves amidst its fire-scathed walls, and
to devote their lives to piety and toil.--In pursuing the
deer, the Duke chanced to wander to Jumieges, and he there beheld
the monks employed in clearing the ground. He listened with
patience to their narration; but when they invited him to partake
of their humble fare, barley-bread and water, he turned from them
with disdain. It chanced, however, that immediately afterwards, he
encountered in the forest a boar of enormous size. The beast
unhorsed him, and he was in danger of death. The peril he regarded
as a judgment from heaven; and, as an expiation for his folly, he
rebuilt the monastery. So thoroughly, however, had the Normans
<i>demonachised</i> Neustria, that William Longa Spatha was
compelled to people the abbey with a colony from Poitou; and thence
came twelve monks, headed by Abbot Martin, whom the duke installed
in his office in the year 930. William himself also desired to take
refuge from the fatigues of government in the retirement of the
monastery; and though dissuaded by Abbot Martin, who reminded him
that Richard, his infant, son still needed his care, he did not
renounce his intention:--but his life and his reign were soon
ended by treachery.</p>

<p>This second &aelig;ra of the prosperity of Jumieges was
extremely short; for the prefect, whom Louis d'Outremer, King of
France, placed in command at Rouen, when he seized upon the young
Duke Richard, pulled down the <a name="Page_25"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;25]</span></a>walls of this and of all the
other monasteries on the banks of the Seine, to assist towards the
reparation and embellishment of the seat of his government. But
from that time forward the tide of monastic affairs flowed in one
even course of prosperity; though the present abbatial church was
not begun till the time of Abbot Robert, the second of that name,
who was elected in 1037. By him the first stone of the foundation
was laid, three years after his advancement to the dignity; but he
held his office only till 1043, when Edward the Confessor invited
him to England, and immediately afterwards promoted him to the
Bishopric of London.--Godfrey, his successor at Jumieges, was
a man conversant with architecture, and earnest in the promotion of
learning. In purchasing books and in causing them to be
transcribed, he spared neither pains nor expence. The records of
the monastery contain a curious precept, in which he directs that
prayers should be offered up annually upon a certain day, "pro
illis qui dederunt et fecerunt libros."--The inmates of
Jumieges continued, however, to increase in number; and the
revenues of the abbey would not have been adequate to defray the
expences of the new building, had not Abbot Robert, who, in 1050,
had been translated to the see of Canterbury, supplied the
deficiency by his munificence, and, as long as he continued to be
an English prelate, remitted the surplus of his revenues to the
Norman abbey. He held his archiepiscopal dignity only one year, at
the expiration of which he was banished from England: he then
retired to Jumieges, where he died the following spring, and was
buried in the choir of the church which he had begun to raise. At
his death, the church <a name="Page_26"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;26]</span></a>had neither nave nor windows;
and the whole edifice was not completed till November, in the year
1066. In the following July the dedication took place. Maurilius,
Archbishop of Rouen, officiated, in great pomp, assisted by all the
prelates of the duchy; and William, then just returned from the
conquest of England, honored the ceremony with his presence.</p>

<p>I have dwelt upon the early history of this monastery, because
Normandy scarcely furnishes another of greater interest. In the
<i>Neustria Pia</i>, Jumieges fills nearly seventy closely-printed
folio pages of that curious and entertaining, though credulous,
work.--What remains to be told of its annals is little more
than a series of dates touching the erection of different parts of
the building: these, however, are worth preserving, so long as any
portion of the noble church is permitted to have existence, and so
long as drawings and engravings continue to perpetuate the
remembrance of its details.</p>

<p>The choir and extremities of the transept, all of pointed
architecture, are supposed to have been rebuilt in 1278.--The
Lady-Chapel was an addition of the year 1326.--The abbey
suffered materially during the wars between England and France, in
the reigns of our Henry IVth and Henry Vth: its situation exposed
it to be repeatedly pillaged by the contending parties; and, were
it not that the massy Norman architecture sufficiently indicates
the true date, and that we know our neighbors' habit of applying
large words to small matters, we might even infer that it was then
destroyed as effectually as it had been by Ironside: the
expression, "lamentabilit&egrave;r desolata, diffracta et
annihilata," could <a name="Page_27"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;27]</span></a>scarcely convey any meaning
short of utter ruin, except to the ears of one who had been told
that a religious edifice was actually <i>abim&eacute;</i> during
the revolution, though he saw it at the same moment standing before
him, and apparently uninjured.--The arched roof of the choir
received a complete repair in 1535: that of the nave, which was
also in a very bad state, underwent the same process in 1688; at
the same time, the slender columns that support the cornice were
replaced with new ones, and the symbols of the Evangelists were
inserted in the upper part of the walls. These reparations are
managed with a singular perception of propriety; and though the
manner of the sculpture in the symbolic figures, is not that of a
Gothic artist, yet they are most appropriate, and harmonize
admirably with the building.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_09"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_09.png" height="218" width="377" alt="Symbols of the Evangelists" /></p>

<p>You must excuse me that, now I am upon this subject, I venture
to "travel somewhat out of the record," for the sake of proposing
to you a difficulty which has long <a name="Page_28"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;28]</span></a>puzzled me:--the connection
which Catholic divines find between St. Luke's Bull and the word
Zecharias;--for it appears, by the following distich from the
Rhenish Testament, that some such cause leads them to regard this
symbol as peculiarly appropriate to the third
Evangelist:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Effigies vituli, Luca, tibi convenit; extat</p>

<p>&nbsp;Zacari&aelig; in scriptis mentio prima tuis."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_10"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_10.png" height="271" width="378" alt="Figures of effigies" /></p>

<p>An antiquary might be perplexed by these figures, the drawings
whereof I now send you. He would find it impossible to suppose the
exquisitely-sculptured images and the slender shafts with
richly-wrought capitals, of the same date as the solid simple piers
and arches all around; and yet the stone is so entirely the same,
and the workmanship <a name="Page_29"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;29]</span></a>is so well united, that it would
require an experienced eye to trace the junction. In the middle of
the sixteenth century, the central tower was also found to need
reparation; and the church, upon this occasion, sustained a lasting
injury, in the loss of its original spire, which was of lead, and
of great height and beauty. It was taken down, under pretence of
its insecurity; but in reality the monks only wished to get the
metal. This happened in 1557, under Gabriel le Veneur, Bishop of
Evreux, the then abbot. Five years afterwards the ravages of the
Huguenots succeeded: the injury done to Jumieges by these
sectaries, was estimated at eighty thousand francs; and the library
and records of the convent perished in the devastation.</p>

<p>The western front of the church still remains almost perfect;
and it is most singular. It consists, of three distinct parts; the
central division being nearly of equal width to the other two
conjointly, and projecting considerably beyond them. The character
of the whole is simplicity: the circular door-way is comparatively
small, and entirely without ornament, except a pillar on each side;
the six circular-headed windows over the entrance, disposed in a
double row, are equally plain. Immediately above the upper tier of
windows, is a projecting chequered cornice; and, still higher,
where the gable assumes a triangular form, are three lancet-shaped
apertures, so extremely narrow, that they resemble the loop-holes
of a dungeon rather than the windows of a church. In each of the
lateral compartments was likewise originally a door-way, and above
it a single window, all of the same Norman style, but all now
blocked up. These compartments <a name="Page_30"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;30]</span></a>are surmounted with short
towers, capped with conical spires. The towers appear from their
style and masonry to be nearly coeval with the lower part of the
building, though not altogether so: the southern is somewhat the
most modern. They are, however, so entirely dissimilar in plan from
the rest of the front, that we cannot readily admit that they are a
portion of the original design. Nor are they even like to each
other. Both of them are square at their bases, and preserve this
form to a sufficient height to admit of two tiers of narrow
windows, separated from each other by little more than a simple
string-course. Above these windows both become octagon, and
continue so to the top; but in a very different manner. The
northern one has obtuse angles, imperfectly defined; the southern
has four projecting buttresses and four windows, alternating with
each other. The form of the windows and their arrangement, afford
farther marks of distinction. The octagon part is in both turrets
longer than the square, but, like it, divided into two stories.</p>

<p>The central tower of the church, which was large and square, is
now reduced to a fragment: three of its sides are gone; the western
remains sufficiently perfect to shew what the whole was when
entire. It contained a double tier of arches, the lower consisting
of two, which were large and simple, the upper of three, divided by
central shafts and masonry, so that each formed a double window.
All of them were circular-headed, but so far differed from the
architecture of the nave, that they had side-pillars with
capitals.</p>

<p><a name="Page_31"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;31]</span></a></p>
<p>The church<a name="FNanchor15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> was entered by a long narrow
porch.--The nave is a fine specimen of Norman architecture,
but is remarkable in that style for one striking peculiarity, that
the eight wide circular arches on either side, which separate it
from the aisles, are alternately supported by round pillars and
square piers; the latter having semi-cylindrical columns applied to
each of their sides. The capitals are ornamented with rude volutes.
The arches in the triforium are of nearly the same width as those
below, but considerably less in height. There is no archivolt or
moulding or ornament. Above these there is only one row of windows,
which, like all the rest, are semi-circular headed; but they have
neither angular pillars, nor mouldings, nor mullions. These windows
are rather narrow externally, but within the opening enlarges
considerably. The windows in the upper and lower tiers stand
singly: in the intermediate row they are disposed by threes, the
central one separated from the other two by a single
column.--The inside of the nave is striking from its
simplicity: it is wholly of the eleventh century, except the
reparations already mentioned, which were made <a name="Page_32"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;32]</span></a>in
1688.--The choir and Lady-Chapel are nearly demolished; and
only some fragments of them are now standing: they were of pointed
architecture, and posterior to the nave by at least two
centuries.</p>

<p>A smaller church, dedicated to St. Peter, stood near the
principal one, with which it was connected by means of a corridor
of pointed arches. There are other instances of two churches being
erected within the precincts of one abbey, as at Bury St. Edmund's.
St. Peter's was a building at least of equal antiquity with the
great church. But it had undergone such alterations in the year
1334, during the prelacy of the twenty-seventh abbot, William
Gemblet, that little of the original structure remained. He
demolished nearly the whole of the nave, for the sake of adding
uniformity to the cloisters of the monastery.--M. Le Prevost,
however, is of opinion, that the ruins of Jumieges contain nothing
more interesting to an antiquary than the west end of the portion
of building, which subsequently served as the nave. It is a mass of
flint-work; and he considers it as having belonged to the church
that existed before the incursion of the Normans.</p>

<p>The cloisters, which stood to the south-west of St. Peter's, are
now almost wholly destroyed.--To the west of them is a large
hall or gallery, known by the name of <i>la Salle des
Chevaliers</i>. It is entered by two porches, one towards the
north-west, the other towards the south-west<a name="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>, both
full of architectural beauty and curiosity. I know of no authority
for their date; but, <a name="Page_33"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;33]</span></a>from the great variety and
richness of their ornaments, and the elegant taste displayed in the
arrangement of these, I should suppose them to have been erected
during the latter half of the twelfth century: one of the arches is
unquestionably pointed, though the cusp of the arch is very obtuse.
The slight sketch which accompanies this letter, represents a
fragment of the inner door-way of the south-west porch, and may
enable you to form your own judgment upon the subject.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_11"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_11.png" height="245" width="257" alt="Sketch of fragment of inner door-way" /></p>

<p>The stones immediately over the entrance are joggled into each
other, the key-stone having a joggle on either side.--I have
not observed this peculiarity in any other specimen of Norman
masonry.--Between these porches apartments, along the interior
of which runs a cornice, supported by grotesque corbels, and under
it a row of windows, now principally blocked up, disposed in <a
name="Page_34"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;34]</span></a>triplets, a trefoil-headed
window being placed between two that are semi-circular, as seen in
the accompanying drawing. The date of the origin of the
trefoil-headed arch has been much disputed: these perhaps are some
of the earliest, and they are unquestionably coeval with the
building.</p>

<p>The stupid and disgraceful barbarism, which is now employing
itself in the ruins of Jumieges, has long since annihilated the
invaluable monuments which it contained.--In the Lady-Chapel
of the conventual church was buried the heart of the celebrated
Agnes Sorel, mistress of Charles VIIth, who died at Mesnil, about a
league from this abbey, during the time when her royal lover was
residing here.--Her death was generally attributed to poison;
nor did the people hesitate in whispering that the fatal potion was
administered by order of the Queen. Her son, the profligate tyrant
Louis XIth, detested his father's concubine; and once, forgetting
his dignity and his manhood, he struck the <i>Dame de
Beaut&eacute;</i>.--The statue placed upon the mausoleum
represented Agnes kneeling and offering her heart to the virgin;
but this effigy had been removed before the late troubles: a heart
of white marble, which was at the foot of the tomb, had also
disappeared. According to the annals of the abbey, they were
destroyed by the Huguenots. The tomb itself, with various brasses
inlaid upon it, remained undisturbed till the period of the
revolution, when the whole memorial was removed, and even her
remains were not suffered to rest in peace. The slab of black
marble which covered them, and which bore upon its edges the French
inscription to her memory, is still in existence; though it has
changed its place and destination. The barbarians <a name="Page_35"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;35]</span></a>who
pillaged the convent sold it with the rest of the plunder; and it
now serves as a threshold to a house near the Mont aux Malades, at
Rouen<a name="FNanchor17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. The inscription, which is cut
in very elegant Gothic characters, is as follows: a part of it is,
however, at present hidden by its position:--"Cy gist Agnes
Surelle, noble damoiselle, en son vivant Dame de Roqueferriere, de
Beault&eacute;, d'Yssouldun, et de Vernon sur Seine, piteuse entre
toutes gens, qui de ses biens donnoit largement aux gens
d'&eacute;glise et aux pauvres; qui trespassa le neuvieme jour de
Fevrier, l'an de grace 1449.--Priez Dieu pour elle."--It
is justly to be regretted, that some pains are not taken for the
preservation of this relic, which even now would be an ornament to
the cathedral.--The manor-house at Mesnil, where the fair lady
died, still retains its chimneys of the fifteenth century; and
ancient paintings are discernible on the walls.</p>

<p>The monument in the church of St. Peter, generally known by the
name of <i>le tombeau des &eacute;nervez</i>, was of still greater
singularity. It was an altar-tomb, raised about two feet above the
pavement; and on the slabs were carved whole-length figures, in
alto-relievo, of two boys, each about sixteen years of age, in rich
attire, and ornamented with diadems, broaches, and girdles, all
copiously studded with precious stones. Various traditions
concerning this monument are recorded by authors, and particularly
at great length by Father du Plessis<a name="FNanchor18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>.--<a name="Page_36"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;36]</span></a>The
nameless princes, for such the splendor of their garb denotes them
to have been, were considered, according to a tradition which
prevailed from very early times, as the sons of Clovis and
Bathilda, who, in the absence of their father, were guilty of
revolt, and were punished by being hamstrung; for this is the
meaning of the word <i>&eacute;nervez</i>.--According to this
tradition, the monks, in the thirteenth century, caused the
monument to be ornamented with golden fleurs-de-lys, and added the
following epitaph:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Hic in honore Dei requiescit stirps Clodovei,</p>

<p class="i4">Patris bellica gens, bella salutis agens.</p>

<p class="i1">&nbsp;Ad votum matris Bathildis poenituere,</p>

<p class="i4">Scelere pro proprio, proque labore
patris."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Three other lines, preserved by Yepez, in his chronicle, refer
to the same tale, but accuse the princes of a crime of deeper die
than mere rebellion against parental authority:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Conjugis est ultus probrum; nam in vincula
tradit</p>

<p class="i1">&nbsp;Crudeles natos, pius impietate, simulque</p>

<p class="i1">&nbsp;Et duras pater, o Clodovee, piusque
maritus."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mabillon supposed the tomb to have been erected for Tassilo and
his son; but I do not know how this conjecture is to be reconciled
to the appearance of the statues, both representing persons of
equal age. An examination of the grave at the time of the
destruction of the abbey, might have afforded some interesting
results; though, had any discovery been made, it would have been
but a poor reward for the desolation which facilitated the
research.</p>

Allusions to the cultivation of the vine at Jumieges, as then
commonly practised, may be found in many other public documents of
the fifteenth century: but we may come yet nearer our own time; for
we know that, in the year 1500, there was still a vineyard in the
hamlet of Conihoult, a dependence upon Jumieges, and that the wine
called <i>vin de Conihoult</i>, is expressly mentioned among the
articles of which the charitable donations of the monastery
consisted.--We are told, too, that at least eighteen or twenty
acres, belonging to the grounds of the abbey itself, were used as a
vineyard as late as 1561.--At present, I believe, vines are
scarcely any where to be seen in Normandy, much north of
Gaillon.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XVI"></a>LETTER XVI.</h2>

<h4>GOURNAY--CASTLE OF NEUFMARCH&Eacute;--CASTLE AND
CHURCH OF GISORS.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Gisors, July</i>, 1818)</p>

<p>We are now approaching the western frontiers.--Gournay,
Gisors, and Andelys, the objects of our present excursion, are
disposed nearly in a line between the capitals of France and
Normandy; and whenever war broke out between the two states, they
experienced all the glory, and all the afflictions of warfare. This
district was in fact a kind of debatable land; and hence arose the
numerous strong holds, by which the country was once defended, and
whose ruins now adorn the landscape.</p>

<p>The tract known by modern topographers, under the names of the
<i>arrondissemens</i> of Gournay and of Andelys, constituted one of
the general divisions of ancient Normandy, the <i>Pays de Bray</i>.
It was a tract celebrated beyond every other in France, and, from
time immemorial, for the excellence of the products of its dairies.
The butter of Bray is an indispensable requisite at every
fashionable table at Paris; and the <i>fromage de
Neufchâtel</i> is one of the only two French cheeses which
are honored with a place in the bill of fare at V&eacute;ry's at
Grignon's, or at Beauvilliers'.</p>

<p>The females of the district frequently passed us on the road,
carrying their milk and eggs to the provincial metropolis.
Accustomed as we are to the Norman costume, <a name="Page_38"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;38]</span></a>we still thought that the
many-colored attire and long lappetted cap, of the good wife, of
Bray, in conjunction with her steed and its trappings, was a most
picturesque addition to the surrounding scenery. The large pannier
on either side of the saddle leaves little room for the lady,
except on the hinder parts of the poor beast; and there she sits,
perfectly free and <i>d&eacute;gag&eacute;e</i>, without either
pillion or stirrup, showing no small portion of her leg, and
occasionally waving a little whip, ornamented in the handle with
tufts of red worsted.--We had scarcely quitted the suburbs of
Rouen before we found ourselves in Darn&eacute;tal, a place that
has risen considerably in importance, since the revolution, from
the activity of its numerous manufacturers. Its population is
composed entirely of individuals of this description, to whose
pursuits its situation upon the banks of the Robec and Aubette is
peculiarly favorable: the greater part of the goods manufactured
here are coarse cloths and flannels. Before the revolution, the
town belonged to the family of Montmorenci.--The rest of the
ride offered no object of interest. The road, like all the main
post-roads, is certainly wide and straight; but the French seem to
think that, if these two points are but obtained, all the rest may
be regarded as matter of supererogation. Hence, very little
attention is paid to the surface of the highways: even on those
that are most frequented, it is thought enough to keep the centre,
which is paved, in decent repair: the ruts by the side are
frequently so deep as to be dangerous; and in most cases the cross
roads are absolutely impassable to carriages of every description,
except the common carts of the country.--There is nothing in
which England has <a name="Page_39"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;39]</span></a>a more decided superiority over
France than in the facility of communication between its different
towns; and there is also nothing which more decidedly marks a
superiority of civilization. English travellers, who usually roll
on the beaten track to and from the capital, return home full of
praises of the French roads; but were they to attempt excursions
among the country-towns and villages, their opinion would be
wofully altered.--The forest of Feuill&eacute;e extends about
four leagues on each side of the road, between Rouen and Gournay.
It adds little to the pleasantness of the ride: the trees are
planted with regularity, and the side-branches are trimmed away
almost to the very tops. Those therefore who expect overhanging
branches, or the green-wood shade, in a French forest, will be
sadly disappointed. On the contrary, when the wind blows across the
road, and the sun shines down it, such a forest only adds to the
heat and closeness of the way.</p>

<p>The country around Gournay is characterized by fertility and
abundance; yet, in early times, the rich valley in which it is
situated, was a dreary morass, which separated the Caletes from the
Bellovacences. A causeway crossed the marshes, and formed the only
road of communication between these tribes; and Gournay arose as an
intermediate station. Therefore, even prior to the Norman
&aelig;ra, the town was, from its situation, a strong hold of note;
and under the Norman dukes, Gournay necessarily became of still
greater consequence, as the principal fortress on the French
frontier; but the annexation of the duchy to the crown of France,
destroyed this unlucky pre-eminence; and, at present, it is only
known <a name="Page_40"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;40]</span></a>as a great staple mart for
cheese and butter. Nor is it advantageously situated for trade; as
there is no navigable river or means of water-carriage in its
vicinity. The inhabitants therefore look forward with some anxiety
to the completion of the projected canal from Dieppe.</p>

<p>Gournay is a small, clean, and airy place. The last two
circumstances are no trifling recommendation to those who have just
escaped from the dirt and closeness of Rouen. Its streets are
completely those of a country town: the intermixture of wood and
clay in the houses gives them a mean aspect, and there are scarcely
two to be found alike, either in size, shape, color, or
materials.--The records of Gournay begin in the reign of
Rollo. That prince gave the town, together with the Norman portion
of the Pays de Bray, to Eudes<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, a nobleman of his own nation,
to be held as a fief of the duchy, under the usual military tenure.
In one of the earliest rolls of Norman chieftains<a name="FNanchor20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>, the
Lord of Gournay is bound, in case of war, to supply the duke with
twelve soldiers from among his vassals, and to arm his dependants
for the defence of his portion of the marches. Hugh, the son of
Eudes de Gournay, erected a castle in the vicinity of the church of
St. Hildebert, and the whole town was surrounded with a triple wall
and double fosse. The place was inaccessible to an invading enemy,
when these fosses were filled with the waters of the Epte; but
Philip Augustus caused the protecting element to become his most
powerful auxiliary. Willelmus Brito relates <a name="Page_41"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;41]</span></a>this siege with minuteness
in his <i>Philippiad</i>, an heroic poem, devoted to the acts and
deeds of the French monarch.--After advancing through Lions
and Mortemer, Philip encamped before Gournay, thus described by the
historical bard;--</p>

<p>In 1350, after the death of Philip of Valois, Gournay was again
separated from France, and given as a dower to Blanche of Navarre,
the widow of that prince, who held it forty-eight years, when,
after her death, it reverted to the crown. At the commencement of
the following century, the town fell, with the rest of the kingdom,
into the possession of the English; and once more, upon the demise
of our sovereign, Henry Vth, formed part of the dower of the
widowed queen. On her decease, it devolved upon her son; but a
period of eleven years had scarcely elapsed, when the laws of
conquest united it for a third time to the crown of France, in
1449.--From that period to the revolution, it was constantly
in the possession of different noble families of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The name of Hugo de Gournay is enrolled amongst those who
followed the conqueror into England, and who held lands <i>in
capite</i> from him in this country<a name="FNanchor21"></a><a
href="#Footnote_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>. Hugo was a man of eminent
valor, and his services were requited by the grant of many large
possessions; but, after all his military actions, he sought repose
in the abbey of Bec, which had been enriched by his piety. His son,
Girald, who married the sister of William, Earl Warren, accompanied
Robert, Duke of Normandy, into the Holy Land; and the grandson of
Girald was in the number of those who followed Richard
Coeur-de-Lion in a similar expedition, and was appointed his
commissioner, to receive the English share of the spoil, after the
capture of Acre. He was also among the barons who rose against King
John. Their descendants settled <a name="Page_43"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;43]</span></a>in very early times in our own
county, where their possessions were extensive and valuable.</p>

<p>It was in Gournay that the unfortunate Arthur, heir to the
throne of England, received the order of knighthood, together with
the earldoms of Brittany, Poitou, and Angers, from Philip Augustus,
immediately previously to entering upon the expedition, which
ultimately ended with his death; and, according to tradition, it
was on this occasion that the town adopted for its arms the sable
shield, charged with a knight in armor, argent<a name="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Gournay has now no other remains of antiquity, except the
collegiate church of St. Hildebert<a name="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>, which was founded towards the
conclusion of the eleventh century, though it was scarcely
completed at the end of the thirteenth. Hence the discrepancy of
style observable in the architecture of its different parts. The
west front, in which the windows are all pointed, was probably one
of the last portions completed. The interior is principally of
semi-circular architecture, with piers unusually massy, and
capitals no less fanciful and extraordinary than those already
noticed at St. Georges. Here, however, we have fewer monsters. The
ornaments consist chiefly of foliage, and wreaths, and knots, and
chequered work, and imitations of members of the antique capital.
Some of the pillars, instead of ending in regular capitals, are
surmounted by a narrow projecting rim, carved with undulating
lines. It has been supposed that this ornament, <a name="Page_44"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;44]</span></a>which is
quite peculiar to the church of St. Hildebert, is a kind of
hieroglyphical representation of water.--Perhaps, it is the
chamber of Sagittarius; or, perhaps, it is a <i>fess wavy</i>, to
which the same signification has been assigned by heralds.--If
this interpretation be correct, the symbol is allusive to the
ancient situation of the town, built in the midst of a marsh,
intersected by two streams, the Epte and the St. Aubin.</p>

<p>While we were on the point of setting out from Gournay, we had
the pleasure of meeting Mr. Cotman, who landed a few days since at
Dieppe, and purposes remaining in Normandy, to complete a series of
drawings which he began last year, towards the illustration of the
architectural antiquities of the duchy. He has joined our party,
and we are likely to have the advantage of his society for some
little time.</p>

<p>The village of Neufmarch&eacute;, about a league from Gournay,
on the right bank of the Epte, still retains a small part of its
castle, built by Henry Ist, to command the passage of the river,
and to serve as a barrier against the incursions of the French. Its
situation is good, upon an artificial hill, surrounded by a fosse;
and the principal entrance is still tolerably entire. But the rest
is merely a shapeless heap of ruins: the interior is wholly under
the plough; and the fragments of denudated walls preserve small
remains of the coating of large square stones, which formerly
embellished and protected them. Neufmarch&eacute;, in the days of
Norman sovereignty, was one of the strong holds of the duchy. The
chroniclers<a name="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> speak of the village as being
defended by a <a name="Page_45"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;45]</span></a>fortress, in the reign of
William the Conqueror. The church, too, with its semi-circular
architecture, attests the antiquity of the station.</p>

<p>Long before we reached Gisors, we had a view of the keep of the
castle, rising majestically above the town, which is indeed at
present "une assez maussade petite ville, qui n'a gu&egrave;re
qu'une rue." From its position and general outline, the castle, at
first view, resembles the remains of Launceston, in Cornwall. It
recalled to my mind the impressions of surprise, mixed with
something approaching to awe, which seized me, when the first
object that met my eyes in the morning (for it was late and dark
when I reached Launceston) was the noble keep, towering immediately
above my chamber windows, and so near, that it appeared as if I had
only to open them and step into it. I do not mean to draw a
parallel between the castles of Launceston and Gisors, and still
less am I about to inquire into the relationship between the Norman
and the Cornish fortresses. The lapse of twenty years has
materially weakened my recollection of the latter, nor would this
be a seasonable opportunity for such a disquisition: but the
subject deserves investigation, the result of which may tend to
establish the common origin of both, and to dissipate the
day-dreams of Borlase, who longed to dignify the castellated ruins
of the Cornish peninsula, by ascribing them to the Roman conquerors
of Britain.</p>

<p>Gisors itself existed before the tenth century; but its chief
celebrity was due to William Rufus, who, anxious to strengthen his
frontiers against the power of <a name="Page_46"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;46]</span></a>the kings of France, caused
Robert of Bell&ecirc;me to erect this castle, in 1097. Thus then we
have a certain date; and there is no reason to believe, but that
the whole of what is left us is really of the same &aelig;ra, or of
the following reign, in which it is known that the works were
greatly augmented; for Henry Ist was completely a castle-builder.
He was a prince who spared no pains in strengthening and defending
the natural frontiers of his province, as the fortresses of
Verneuil, Tilli&egrave;res, Nonancourt, Anet, Ivry,
Château-sur-Epte, Gisors, and many others, abundantly
testify. All these were either actually built, or materially
strengthened by him.--This at Gisors, important from its
strength and from its situation, was the source of frequent
dissentions between the sovereigns of England and France, as well
as the frequent witness of their plighted faith, and the scene of
their festivities.--In 1119, a well-known interview took place
here, between Henry Ist and Pope Calixtus IInd, who had travelled
to France for the purpose of healing the schisms in the church, and
who, after having accomplished that task, was desirous not to quit
the kingdom till he had completed the work of pacification, by
reconciling Henry to Louis le Gros, and to his brother, Robert. The
speech of our sovereign upon this occasion, as recorded by
Ordericus Vitalis<a name="FNanchor25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>, is a valuable document to the
English historian: it sets forth, at considerable length, his
various causes of grievance, whether real, imaginary, or invented,
against the legal heir to our throne.--After a lapse of
thirty-nine years, Louis le Jeune succeeded in annexing Gisors to
the <a name="Page_47"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;47]</span></a>crown of France; but he resigned
it to our Henry IInd, only three years subsequently, as a part of
the marriage portion of his daughter, Margaret. It then remained
with our countrymen till the conquest of the duchy by Philip
Augustus; previously to which event, that sovereign and Henry met,
in the year 1188, under an elm near Gisors, on the road to Trie,
upon receiving the news of the capture of Jerusalem by the Sultan
Saladin<a name="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>. The monarchs, actuated by
religious zeal, took up the cross, and mutually pledged themselves
to suspend for <a name="Page_48"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;48]</span></a>a while their respective
differences, and direct their united efforts against the common foe
of the christian faith, Legends also tell that, during the
conference, a miraculous cross appeared in the air, as if in
ratification of the compact; and hence the inhabitants derive the
armoria bearing of the town; <i>gules</i>, a cross engrailed
<i>or</i><a name="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>. In 1197, Philip embellished
Gisors with new buildings; and he retired hither the following
year, after the battle of Courcelles, a conflict, which began by
his endeavor to surprise Richard Coeur-de-Lion, but which ended
with his total defeat. He had well nigh lost his life during the
flight, by his horse plunging with him, all armed as he was, into
the Epte.--He took refuge in Gisors; and the <i>golden
gate</i> of the town commemorated his gratitude. With eastern
magnificence, he caused the entire portal to be covered with gold;
and the statue of the Virgin, which surmounted it, received the
same splendor.</p>

<p>During the wars between France and England, in the fifteenth
century, Gisors was repeatedly won and lost by the contending
parties. In later and more peaceable times, it has been only known
as the provincial capital of the bailiwick of Gisors, and of the
Norman portion of the Vexin.</p>

<p>The castle consists of a double ballium, the inner occupying the
top of a high artificial mound, in whose centre stands the keep.
The whole of the fortress is of the most solid masonry. Previously
to the discovery of cannon, it could scarcely be regarded otherwise
than as <a name="Page_49"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;49]</span></a>impregnable, for the site which
it occupies is admirably adapted for defence; and the walls were as
strong as art could make them.--The outer walls were of great
extent: they were defended by two covered ways, and flanked by
several towers, of various shapes.--In the inclosed sketch,
you will observe a circular tower, which is perhaps more perfect
than any of the rest. The two entrances which led to the inner
wards, were defended by more massy towers, strengthened with
portcullises and draw-bridges.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_31"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_31.png" height="473" width="692" alt="Distant of the Castle of Gisors" /></p>

<p>The conical mound is almost inaccessible, on account of its
steepness. The summit is inclosed by a circular wall of
considerable height, pierced with loop-holes, and strengthened at
regular intervals with buttresses, most of which are small and
shallow, and resemble such as are found in the Norman churches.
Those, however, which flank the entrance of the keep, are of a
different character: they project so boldly, that they may rather
be considered as bastions or solid turrets.--The dungeon rises
high above all the rest, a lofty octagon tower, with a turret on
one side of the same shape, intended to receive the winding
staircase, which still remains, but in so shattered a state, that
we could not venture to ascend it. The shell of the keep itself is
nearly perfect, and is also varied in its outline with projecting
piers.--Within the inner ballium, we discovered the remains of
the castle-chapel. More than half, indeed, of the building is
destroyed, but the east end is standing, and is tolerably entire.
The roof is vaulted and groined: the groins spring from short
pillars, whose capitals are beautifully sculptured <a name="Page_50"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;50]</span></a>with
foliage; The architecture of the whole is semi-circular; but I
should apprehend it to be posterior to any part of the
fortress.--The inside of the castle serves at this time for a
market-hall: the fosse, now dry and planted with trees, forms a
delightful walk round the whole.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_32"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_32.png" height="503" width="352" alt="Banded Pillar in the Church of Gisors" /></p>

<p>We were much disappointed by the church of Gisors; in the
illustration of the details of which, Millin is very diffuse. The
building is of considerable magnitude; its proportions are not
unpleasing, and it contains much elaborate sculpture; but the labor
has been ill bestowed, having been lavished without any attention
to consistency. It is throughout a jumble of Roman and Gothic,
except that the exterior of the north transept is wholly Gothic.
Some of the little figures which decorate it are very gracefully
carved, especially in the drapery. A pillar in the south aisle,
entwined by spiral fillets, is of great singularity and beauty. The
dolphin is introduced in each pannel, and the heraldic form of this
fish harmonizes with the gentle curve of the field upon which it is
sculptured. A crown of fleurs-de-lys surrounds the columns at
mid-height. These symbols, as I believe I observed on a former
occasion, are often employed as ornaments by the French architects.
The church, which is dedicated to the twin saints, St. Gervais and
St. Protais, is the work of different &aelig;ras, but principally
of the latter half of the sixteenth century, a time when, as a
Frenchman told me, "l'on commen&ccedil;a &agrave; bâtir dans
le beau style Romain."--The man who made the observation was
of the lower order of society, one of the <i>swinish multitude</i>,
<a name="Page_51"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;51]</span></a>who, in England, never dream
about styles in architecture. I mention the circumstance, for the
sake of pointing out the difference that exists in these matters
between the two countries.</p>

<p>Here, every man, gentle or simple, educated or uneducated,
thinks himself qualified and bound to deliver his opinion on
objects connected with the fine arts; and though such opinions are
of necessity commonly crude, and sometimes absurd, they, on the
other hand, frequently display a degree of feeling, and
occasionally of knowledge, that surprises you. It may be true
indeed, as Dr. Johnson said, with some illiberality, of our
brethren across the Tweed, that though "every man may have a
mouthful, no one has a belly full;" but it still marks a degree of
national refinement, that any attention whatever is bestowed upon
such subjects. This smattering of knowledge, accompanied with the
constant readiness to communicate it, is also agreeable to a
stranger. Except in a few instances at Rouen, I never failed to
find civility and attention among the French. To the ladies of our
nation they are uniformly polite though occasionally their
compliments may appear of somewhat a questionable complexion; as it
happened to a female friend of mine to be told, while drawing the
church of St, Ouen, "qu'elle avait de l'esprit comme quatre
diables."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XVII"></a>LETTER XVII.</h2>

<h4>ANDELYS--FOUNTAIN OF SAINT CLOTILDA--LA GRANDE
MAISON--CH&Acirc;TEAU GAILLARD--ECOUIS.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Ecouis, July</i>, 1818)</p>

<p>Our evening journey from Gisors to Andelys, was not without its
inconveniences.--The road, if road it may be called, was
sometimes merely a narrow ravine or trench, so closely bordered by
trees and underwood, that our vehicle could scarcely force its way;
and sometimes our jaded horses labored along a waggon-way which
wound amidst an expanse of corn-fields. Our postilion had earnestly
requested us to postpone our departure till the following morning;
and he swore and cursed most valiantly during the whole of his
ride. On our arrival, however, at Andelys, a few kind words from my
companions served to mitigate his ire; and as their eloquence may
have been assisted by a few extra sous, presented to him at the
same time, his nut-brown countenance brightened up, and all was
tranquillity.</p>

<p>Andelys is a town, whose antiquity is not to be questioned: it
had existence in the time of the venerable Bede, by whom it is
expressly mentioned, under its Latin appellation,
<i>Andilegum</i><a name="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a>. The derivation of this name has
afforded employment to etymologists. The syllable <i>and</i>
enters, as it is said, into the composition of the names of sundry
places, reported to be founded by Franks, and Saxons, and Germans;
and therefore it is agreed that a Teutonic origin must be assigned
to Andelys. But, as <a name="Page_53"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;53]</span></a>to the import of this same
syllable, they are all of them wholly at a loss.--The history
of Andelys is brief and unimportant, considering its antiquity and
situation. It was captured by Louis le Gros in the war which he
undertook against Henry Ist, in favour of Clito, heir of the
unfortunate Duke Robert; and his son, Louis le Jeune, in 1166,
burned Andelys to the ground, thus revenging the outrages committed
by the Anglo-Normans in France: in 1197, it was the subject of the
exchange which I have already mentioned, between Richard
Coeur-de-Lion and Walter, Archbishop of Rouen; and only a few years
afterwards it passed by capitulation into the possession of Philip
Augustus, when the murder of Arthur of Brittany afforded the French
sovereign a plausible pretext for dispossessing our worthless
monarch of his Norman territory.</p>

<p>What Andelys wants, however, in secular interest, it makes up in
sanctity. Saint Clotilda founded a very celebrated monastery here,
which was afterwards destroyed by the Normans.--If we now send
our ripening daughters to France, to be schooled and accomplished,
the practice prevailed equally amongst our Anglo-Saxon ancestors;
and we learn from Bede, that Andelys was then one of the most
fashionable establishments<a name="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>. However, we must not forget
that the fair Elfleda, and the rosy &AElig;lfgiva, were so taught
in the convent, as to be <a name="Page_54"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;54]</span></a>fitted only for the embraces of
a celestial husband--a mode of matrimony which has most
fortunately become obsolete in our days of increasing knowledge and
civilization.</p>

<p>After the destruction of the monastery by the Normans, it was
never rebuilt; yet its sanctity is not wholly lost. At the behest
of Clotilda, the waters of the fountain of Andelys were changed
into wine for the relief of the weary labourer, and the tutelary
saint is still worshipped by the faithful.</p>

<p>It was our good fortune to arrive at Andelys on the vigil of the
festival of Saint Clotilda. The following morning, at early dawn,
the tolling bell announced the returning holiday; and then we saw
the procession advance, priests and acolytes bearing crosses and
consecrated banners and burning tapers, followed by a joyous crowd
of votaries and pilgrims. We had wished to approach the holy well;
but the throng thickened around it, and we were forced to desist.
We could not witness the rites, whatever they were, which were
performed at the fountain; and long after they had concluded, it
was still surrounded by groups of women, some idling and staring,
some asking charity and whining, and some conducting their little
ones to the salutary-fountain. Many are the infirmities and
ailments which are relieved through the intercession of Saint
Clotilda, after the patient has been plunged in the gelid spring. A
Parisian sceptic might incline to ascribe a portion of their cures
to cold-bathing and ablution; but, at Andelys, no one ever thought
of diminishing the veneration, inspired by the Christian queen of
the founder of the monarchy. Several children were pointed out to
us, heretical strangers, as living <a name="Page_55"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;55]</span></a>proofs of the continuance of
miracles in the Catholic church. They had been cured on the
preceding anniversary; for it is only on Saint Clotilda's day that
her benign influence is shed upon the spring.</p>

<p>Andelys possesses a valuable specimen of ancient domestic
architecture. The <i>Great House</i><a name="FNanchor30"></a><a
href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> is a most sumptuous
mansion, evidently of the age of Francis Ist; but I could gain no
account of its former occupants or history. I must again borrow
from my friend's vocabulary, and say, that it is built in the
"Burgundian style." In its general outline and character, it
resembles the house in the <i>Place de la Pucelle</i>, at Rouen.
Its walls, indeed, are not covered with the same profusion of
sculpture; yet, perhaps, its simplicity is accompanied by greater
elegance.--The windows are disposed in three divisions, formed
by slender buttresses, which run up to the roof. They are
square-headed, and divided by a mullion and transom.--The
portal is in the centre: it is formed by a Tudor arch, enriched
with deep mouldings, and surmounted by a lofty ogee, ending with a
crocketed pinnacle, which transfixes the cornice immediately above,
as well as the sill of the window, and then unites with the mullion
of the latter.--The roof takes a very high pitch.--A
figured cornice, upon which it rests, is boldly sculptured with
foliage.--The chimneys are ornamented by angular
buttresses.--All these portions of the building assimilate
more or less to our Gothic architecture of the sixteenth century;
but a most magnificent oriel window, which fills the whole of the
space between the centre and left-hand <a name="Page_56"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;56]</span></a>divisions, is a specimen
of pointed architecture in its best and purest style. The arches
are lofty and acute. Each angle is formed by a double buttress, and
the tabernacles affixed to these are filled with statues. The
basement of the oriel, which projects from the flat wall of the
house, after the fashion of a bartizan, is divided into
compartments, studded with medallions, and intermixed with tracery
of great variety and beauty. On either side of the bay, there are
flying buttresses of elaborate sculpture, spreading along the
wall.--As, comparatively speaking, good models of ancient
domestic architecture are very rare, I would particularly recommend
this at Andelys to the notice of every architect, whom chance may
conduct to Normandy.--This building, like too many others of
the same class in our own counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, is
degraded from its station. The <i>great house</i> is used merely as
a granary, though, by a very small expence, it might be put into
habitable repair. The stone retains its clear and polished surface;
and the massy timbers are undecayed.--The inside corresponds
with the exterior, in decorations and grandeur: the chimney-pieces
are large and elaborate, and there is abundance of sculpture on the
ceilings and other parts which admit of ornament.</p>

<p>The French, in speaking of Andelys, commonly use the plural
number, and say, <i>les Andelys</i>, there being a smaller town of
the same name, within the distance of a mile: hence, the larger,
all inconsiderable as it is, and though it scarcely contains two
thousand inhabitants, is dignified by the appellation of <i>le
Grand Andelys</i>.</p>

<p>As the French seldom neglect the memory of their eminent men, I
was rather disappointed at not finding <a name="Page_57"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;57]</span></a>any tribute to the glory
of Poussin, nor any object which could recal his name.--The
great master of the French school was born at Andelys, in 1594, of
poor but noble parents. The talents of the painter of the
<i>Deluge</i> overcame all obstacles. Young Poussin, with barely a
sufficiency to buy his daily bread, found means of making his
abilities known in the metropolis to such advantage, as enabled him
to proceed to Rome, where the patronage of the Cavaliere Marino
smoothed his way to that splendid career, which terminated only
with his life.--And yet I doubt if the example of Poussin has,
on the whole, been favorable to the progress of French art. Horace
Walpole, in his summary of the excellencies and defects of great
painters, observed with much justice, that "Titian wanted to have
seen the antique; Poussin to have seen Titian." The observation
referred principally to the defective coloring, which is admitted
to exist in the greater part of the works of the painter of
Andelys. But Poussin, considered as a model for imitation, and
especially as a model for the student, is liable to a more serious
objection.--He was a total stranger to real
nature:--classical taste, indeed, and knowledge, and grace,
and beauty, pervade all his works; but it is a taste, and a
knowledge, and a grace, and a beauty, formed solely upon the
contemplation of the antique. Horace's adage, that "decipit
exemplar vitiis imitabile," has been remarkably verified in the
case of Poussin; and I am mistaken, if the example set by him,
which has been rigorously followed in the French school, even down
to the present day, has not contributed more than any thing else to
that statuary style in forms, and that coldness in coloring, which
every one, who is not <a name="Page_58"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;58]</span></a>born in France, regrets to see
in the works of the best of their artists.--The learned Adrian
Turnebus was also a native of Andelys; and the church is
distinguished as the burial-place of Corneille.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_33"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_33.png" height="439" width="752" alt="Distant View of Château Gaillard" /></p>

<p>I doubt, however, whether we should have travelled hither, had
we not been attracted by the celebrity of the castle, called
<i>Château Gaillard</i>, erected by Richard Coeur-de-Lion, in
the immediate vicinity of Le Petit Andelys.--Our guide, a
sturdy old dame, remonstrated strongly against our walking so far
to look at a mere heap of stones, nothing comparable to the fine
statue of Clotilda, of which, if we would but have a little
patience, we might still procure a sight.--Our expectations
respecting the castle were more than answered. Considered as to its
dimensions and its situation, it is by far the finest castellated
ruin I ever saw. Conway, indeed, has more beauty; but Château
Gaillard is infinitely superior in dignity. Its ruins crown the
summit of a lofty rock, abruptly rising from the very edge of the
Seine, whose sinuous course here shapes the adjoining land into a
narrow peninsula. The chalky cliffs on each side of the castle, are
broken into hills of romantic shape, which add to the impressive
wildness of the scene. The inclosed sketch will give you an idea,
though a very faint one, of the general appearance of the castle at
a distance. Towards the river, the steepness of the cliff renders
the fortress unassailable: a double fosse of great depth, defended
by a strong wall, originally afforded almost equal protection on
the opposite side.</p>

<p>The circular keep is of extraordinary strength; and in its
construction it differs wholly from any of our English
dungeon-towers.--It may be described as a <a name="Page_59"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;59]</span></a>cylinder,
placed upon a truncated cone. The massy perpendicular buttresses,
which are ranged round the upper wall, from which they project
considerably, lose themselves at their bases in the cone from which
they arise. The building, therefore, appears to be divided into two
stories. The wall of the second story is upwards of twelve feet in
thickness. The base of the conical portion is perhaps twice as
thick.--It seldom happens that the military buildings of the
middle ages have such a <i>talus</i> or slope, on the exterior
face, agreeing with the principles of modern fortification, and it
is difficult to guess why the architect of Château Gaillard
thought fit to vary from the established model of his age. The
masonry is regular and good. The pointed windows are evidently
insertions of a period long subsequent to the original
erection.</p>

<p>The inner, ballium is surrounded by a high circular wall, which
consists of an uninterrupted line of bastions, some semi-circular
and others square.--The whole of this part of the castle
remains nearly perfect. There are also traces of extensive
foundations in various, directions, and of great out-works.
Château Gaillard was in fact a citadel, supported by numerous
smaller fortresses, all of them communicating with the strong
central hold, and disposed so as to secure every defensible post in
the neighborhood. The wall of the outer ballium, which was built of
a compact white and grey stone, is in most places standing, though
in ruins. The original facing only remains in those parts which are
too elevated to admit of its being removed with ease.--Beneath
the castle, the cliff is excavated into a series of subterraneous
caverns, not intended for mere passages or vaults, as at <a name="Page_60"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;60]</span></a>Arques and
in most other places, but forming spacious crypts, supported by
pillars roughly hewn out of the living rock, and still retaining
every mark of the workman's chisel.</p>

<p>It will afford some satisfaction to the antiquary to find, that
the present appearance of the castle corresponds in every important
particular with the description given by Willelmus Brito, who
beheld it within a few years after its erection, and in all its
pride. Every feature which he enumerates yet exists, unaltered and
unobliterated:--</p>

<p>The keep cannot be ascended without difficulty. We ventured to
scale it; and we were fully repaid for our labor by the prospect
which we gained. The Seine, full of green willowy islands, flows
beneath the rock in large lazy windings: the peninsula below is
flat, fertile, and well wooded: on the opposite shores, the
fantastic chalky cliffs rise boldly, crowned with dark forests.</p>

<p>I have already once had occasion to allude to the memorable
strife occasioned by the erection of Château Gaillard, which
its royal founder is reported to have so named by way of mockery.
In possession of this fortress, it seemed that he might laugh to
scorn the attacks of his feudal liege lord.--The date of the
commencement of the building is supposed to have been about the
year 1196, immediately subsequent to the treaty of Louviers, by
which, Richard ceded to Philip Augustus the military line of the
Epte, and nearly the whole of the Norman Vexin. By an express
article of the treaty, neither party was allowed to repair the
fortifications of Andelys; and Philip was in possession of Gisors,
as well as of every other post that might have afforded security to
the Normans. Thus the frontiers of the duchy became defenceless;
but Richard, like other politicians, determined to evade the spirit
of the treaty, adhering nevertheless to its letter, by the erection
of this mighty bulwark.--The building arose with the activity
of fear. Richard died in 1199, yet the castle must have been
completely habitable in his life-time, for not a few of his
charters are dated from Château Gaillard, which he terms "his
beautiful castle of the rock."--Three years only had elapsed
from the decease of this monarch, when Philip Augustus, after <a
name="Page_62"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;62]</span></a>having reduced another castle,
erected at the same time upon an island opposite the lesser
Andelys, encamped before Château Gaillard, and commenced a
siege, which from its length, its horrors, and the valor shewn on
either side, has ever since been memorable in history.--Its
details are given at great length by Father Daniel; and Du Moulin
briefly enumerates a few of the stratagems to which the French King
was obliged to have recourse; for, as the reverend author observes,
"to have attempted to carry the place by force, would have been to
have exposed the army to certain destruction; while to have tried
to scale the walls, would have required the aid of D&aelig;dalus,
with the certainty of a fall, as fatal as that of Icarus;" and
without the poor consolation of</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>".... vitreo daturus</p>

<p>&nbsp;Nomina ponto."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The castle, commanded by Roger de Lacy, defied the utmost
efforts of Philip for six successive months.--So great was its
size; that more than two thousand two hundred persons, who did not
form a part of the garrison, were known to quit the fortress in the
course of the siege, compelled to throw themselves upon the mercy
of the besiegers. But they found none; and the greater part of
these unfortunate wretches, alternately suppliants to either host,
perished from hunger, or from the weapons of the contending
parties. At length the fortress yielded to a sudden assault. Of the
warriors, to whose valor it had been entrusted, only thirty-six
remained alive. John, ill requiting their fidelity, had already
abandoned them to their fate.</p>

<p><a name="Page_63"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;63]</span></a></p>
<p>Margaret of Burgundy, the queen of Louis Xth, and Blanche, the
consort of his brother, Charles le Bel, were both immured in
Château Gaillard, in 1314. The scandalous chronicle of those
times will explain the causes of their imprisonment. Margaret was
strangled by order of her husband. Blanche, after seven years'
captivity, was transferred to the convent of Maubuisson, near
Pontoise, where she continued a recluse till her death--In
1331, David Bruce, compelled to flee from the superior power of the
third Edward, found an asylum in Château Gaillard; and here,
for a time, maintained the pageantry of a court.--Twenty-four
years subsequently, when Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, was sent
as a captive from Rouen to Paris, he was confined here, during one
night, by order of the dauphin, who had made him his prisoner by
treachery, whilst partaking of a banquet.--In the following
century Château Gaillard braved the victorious arms of Henry
Vth; nor was it taken till after a siege of sixteen months. The
garrison only consisted of one hundred and twenty men; yet this
scanty troop would not have yielded, had not the ropes, by which
they drew up their water-buckets<a name="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>, been worn out and
destroyed.--During the same reign, it was again taken and lost
by the French, into whose hands it finally fell in 1449, when
Charles VIIth commanded the siege in person. Even then, however it
stood a long siege; and it was almost the last of the strong-holds
of Normandy, which held out for the successors of the ancient
dukes. After the re-union of the duchy, it was not destroyed, or
suffered to fall into decay, like the greater number of the Norman
fortresses: during the religious wars, it still <a name="Page_64"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;64]</span></a>continued
to be a formidable military post, as well as a royal palace; and it
was honored by the residence of Henry IVth, whose father, Anthony
of Bourbon, died here in 1562.--Its importance ceased in the
following reign.--The inhabitants of the adjacent country
requested the king to order that the castle should be dismantled.
They dreaded, lest its towers should serve as an asylum to some of
the numerous bands of marauders, by whom France was then infested.
It was consequently undermined and reduced to its present state of
ruin.</p>

<p>We did not again attempt to pay our devotions at the shrine of
Saint Clotilda, and we found no interesting object in the church of
Andelys which could detain us. We therefore proceeded without delay
to Ecouis, where we were assured that the church would gratify our
curiosity.--This building has an air of grandeur as it is seen
rising above the flat country; and it is of a singular shape, the
ground-plan being that of a Greek cross. The exterior is plain and
offers nothing remarkable: the interior retains statues of various
saints, which, though not very ancient or in very good taste, are
still far from being inelegant. Saint Mary, the Egyptian, who is
among them, covered with her tresses, which may easily be mistaken
for a long plaited robe, is a saint of unfrequent occurrence in
this part of France. In the choir are several tomb-stones, with
figures engraved upon them, their faces and hands being inlaid with
white marble.--In this part of the building also remains the
tomb of John Marigni, archbishop of Rouen, with his effigy of fine
white marble, in perfect preservation. The face is marked with a
strong expression of that determined character, which he
unquestionably possessed. When he was sent as an <a name="Page_65"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;65]</span></a>ambassador
to Edward IIIrd, in 1342, he made his appearance at the English
court in the guise of a military man, and not as a minister of
peace; and we may doubt whether his virtues qualified him for the
mitre. If even a Pope, however, in latter days, commanded a
sculptor to pourtray him with a sword in his hand, the martial
tendency of an archbishop may well be pardoned in more turbulent
times. The following distich, from his epitaph, alludes to his
achievements:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Armis pr&aelig;cinctus, mentisque charactere cinctus,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Dux fuit in bellis, Anglis virtute rebellis."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The unfortunate Enguerrand de Marigni, brother of the
archbishop, and lord treasurer under Philip the Fair, was the
founder of this church. At the instigation of the king's uncle,
Enguerrand was hanged without trial, and his family experienced the
most bitter persecution. His body, which had at first been interred
in the convent of the Chartreux, at Paris, was removed hither in
1324; and his descendants obtained permission, in 1475, to erect a
mausoleum to his memory. But the king, at the same time that he
acceded to their petition, added the express condition<a name="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>, that
no allusion should be made to Marigni's <a name="Page_66"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;66]</span></a>tragical end. The monument
was destroyed in the revolution; but the murder of the treasurer is
one of those "damned spots," which will never be washed out of the
history of France.--Charles de Valois soon felt the sting of
remorse; and within a year from the wreaking of his vengeance, he
caused alms to be publicly distributed in the streets of Paris,
with an injunction to every one that received them, "to pray to God
for the souls of Enguerrand de Marigni, and Charles de Valois,
taking care to put the subject first<a name="FNanchor33"></a><a
href="#Footnote_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>."--In the church at
Ecouis, was formerly the following epitaph, whose obscurity has
given rise to a variety of traditions:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ci gist le fils, ci gist la mere,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ci gist la soeur, ci gist le fr&egrave;re,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ci gist la femme, et le mari;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Et ci ne sont que deux ici<a name="FNanchor34"></a><a
href="#Footnote_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other inscriptions of the same nature are said to have existed
in England. Goube<a name="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> supposes that this one is the
record of an incestuous connection; but we may doubt whether a less
sinful solution may not be given to the enigma.</p>

<h4>EVREUX--CATHEDRAL--ABBEY OF ST.
TAURINUS--ANCIENT HISTORY.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Evreux, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Our journey to this city has not afforded the gratification
which we anticipated.--You may recollect Ducarel's eulogium
upon the cathedral, that it is one of the finest structures of the
kind in France.--It is our fate to be continually at variance
with the doctor, till I am half inclined to fear you may be led to
suspect that jealousy has something to do with the matter, and that
I fall under the ban of the old Greek proverb,--</p>

<p>[English. Not in Original: The potter is jealous of the potter,
as the builder is jealous of the builder.]</p>

<p>As for myself, however, I do hope and trust that I am
marvellously free from antiquarian spite.--And in this
instance, our expectations were also raised by the antiquity and
sanctity of the cathedral, which was entirely rebuilt by Henry Ist,
who made a considerate bargain with Bishop Audinus<a name="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>, by
which he was allowed to burn the city and <a name="Page_68"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;68]</span></a>its rebellious
inhabitants, upon condition of bestowing his treasures for the
re-construction of the monasteries, after the impending
conflagration. The church, thus raised, is said by William of
Jumieges<a name="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>, to have surpassed every other
in Neustria; but it is certain that only a very small portion of
the original building now remains. A second destruction awaited it.
Philip Augustus, who desolated the county of Evreux with fire and
sword, stormed the capital, sparing neither age nor sex; and all
its buildings, whether sacred or profane, were burnt to the ground.
Hoveden, his friend, and Brito, his enemy, <a name="Page_69"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;69]</span></a>both bear witness to this
fact--the latter in the following lines:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"... irarum stimulis agitatus, ad omne</p>

<p>&nbsp;Excidium partis advers&aelig; totus inardens,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ebroicas prim&ograve; sic incineravit, ut omnes</p>

<p>&nbsp;Cum domibus simul ecclesias consumpserit
ignis."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The church, in its present state, is a medley of many different
styles and ages: the nave alone retains vestiges of early
architecture, in its massy piers and semi-circular arches: these
are evidently of Norman workmanship, and are probably part of the
church erected by Henry.--All the rest is comparatively
modern.--The western front is of a debased Palladian style,
singularly ill adapted to a Gothic cathedral. It is flanked with
two towers, one of which ends in a cupola, the other in a short
cone.--The central tower, which is comparatively plain and
surmounted by a high spire, was built about the middle of the
fifteenth century, during the bishopric of the celebrated John de
Balue, who was in high favor with Louis XIth, and obtained from
that monarch great assistance towards repairing, enlarging, and
beautifying his church. The roof, the transept towards the palace,
the sacristy, the library, and a portion of the cloisters, are all
said to have been erected by him<a name="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a>.--The northern transept is
the only part that can now lay claim to beauty or uniformity in its
architecture: it is of late and bastard Gothic; yet the portal is
not destitute of merit: it is evidently copied from the western
portal of the cathedral at Rouen, though far inferior in every
respect, and with a <a name="Page_70"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;70]</span></a>decided tendency towards the
Italian style. Almost every part of it still appears full of
elaborate ornaments, though all the saints and bishops have fled
from the arched door-way, and the bas-relief which was over the
entrance has equally disappeared.</p>

<p>Ducarel<a name="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> notices four statues of canons,
attached to a couple of pillars at the back of the
chancel.--We were desirous of seeing authentic specimens of
sculpture of a period at least as remote as the conquest; and, as
the garden belonging to the prefect, the Comte de Goyon, <a name="Page_71"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;71]</span></a>incloses
this portion of the church, we requested to be allowed to enter his
grounds. Leave was most obligingly granted, and we received every
attention from the prefect and his lady; but we could find no
traces of the objects of our search. They were probably destroyed
during the revolution; at which time, the count told us that the
statues at the north portal were also broken to pieces. At Evreux,
the democrats had full scope for the exercise of their iconoclastic
fury. Little or no previous injury had been done by the Calvinists,
who appear to have been unable to gain any ascendency in this town
or diocese, at the same time that they lorded it over the rest of
Normandy. Evreux had been fortified against heresy, by the piety
and good sense of two of her bishops: they foresaw the coming
storm, and they took steps to redress the grievances which were
objects of complaint, as well as to reform the
church-establishment, and to revise the breviary and the
mass-book.--Conduct like this seldom fails in its effect; and
the tranquil by-stander may regret that it is not more frequently
adopted by contending parties.</p>

<p>The interior of the cathedral is handsome, though not peculiar.
Some good specimens of painted glass remain in the windows; and, in
various parts of the church, there are elegant tabernacles and
detached pieces of sculpture, as well in stone as in wood. The
pulpit, in particular, is deserving of this praise: it is supported
on cherubs' heads, and is well designed and executed.</p>

<p>The building is dedicated to the Virgin: it claims for its first
bishop, Taurinus, a saint of the third century, <a name="Page_72"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;72]</span></a>memorable
in legendary tale for a desperate battle which he fought against
the devil. Satan was sadly drubbed and the bishop wrenched off one
of his horns<a name="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>. The trophy was deposited in the
crypt of his church, where it long remained, to amuse the curious,
and stand the nurses of Evreux in good stead, as the means of
quieting noisy children.--The learned Cardinal Du Perron
succeeded to St. Taurinus, though at an immense distance <a name="Page_73"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;73]</span></a>of time.
He was appointed by Henry IVth, towards whose conversion he appears
to have been greatly instrumental, as he was afterwards the
principal mediator, by whose intercession the Pope was induced to
grant absolution to the monarch. The task was one of some
difficulty: for the court of Spain, then powerful at the Vatican,
used all their efforts to prevent a reconciliation, with a view of
fomenting the troubles in France.--Most of the bishops of this
see appear to have possessed great piety and talent.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned to you, that the fraternity of the
Conards was established at Evreux, as well as at Rouen. Another
institution, of equal absurdity, was peculiar, I believe, to this
cathedral<a name="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>. It bore the name of the Feast
of St. Vital, as it united with the anniversary of that saint,
which is celebrated on the first of May: the origin of the custom
may be derived from the heathen Floralia, a ceremony begun in
innocence, continued to abomination. At its first institution, the
feast of St. Vital was a simple and a natural rite: the statues of
the saints were crowned with garlands of foliage, perhaps as an
offering of the first-fruits of the opening year. In process of
time, branches were substituted for leaves, and they were cut from
the growing trees, by a lengthened train of rabble
pilgrims.--The clergy themselves headed the mob, who committed
such devastation in the neighboring woods, that the owners of them
were glad to compromise for the safety of their timber, by
stationing persons to supply the physical, as <a name="Page_74"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;74]</span></a>well as
the religious, wants of the populace. The excesses consequent upon
such a practice may easily be imagined: the duration of the feast
was gradually extended to ten days; and, during this time,
licentiousness of all kinds prevailed under the plea of religion.
To use the words of a manuscript, preserved in the archives of the
cathedral, they played at skittles on the roof of the church, and
the bells were kept continually ringing. These orgies, at length,
were quelled; but not till two prebendaries belonging to the
chapter, had nearly lost their lives in the
attempt.--Hitherto, indeed, the clergy had enjoyed the
merriment full as well as the laity. One jolly canon, appropriately
named Jean Bouteille, made a will, in which he declared himself the
protector of the feast; and he directed that, on its anniversary, a
pall should be spread in the midst of the church, with a gigantic
<i>bottle</i> in its centre, and four smaller ones at the corners;
and he took care to provide funds for the perpetuation of this
<i>rebus</i>.</p>

<p>The cathedral offers few subjects for the pencil.--As a
species of monument, of which we have no specimens in England, I
add a sketch of a Gothic <i>puteal</i>, which stands near the north
portal. It is apparently of the same &aelig;ra as that part of the
church.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_34"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_34.png" height="433" width="586" alt="Gothic Puteal, at Evreux" /></p>

<p>From the cathedral we went to the church of St. Taurinus. The
proud abbey of the apostle and first bishop of the diocese retains
few or no traces of its former dignity. So long as monachism
flourished, a contest existed between the chapter of the cathedral
and the brethren of this monastery, each advocating the precedency
<a name="Page_75"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;75]</span></a>of
their respective establishment.--The monks of St. Taurinus
contended, that their abbey was expressly mentioned by William of
Jumieges<a name="FNanchor42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> among the most ancient in
Neustria, as well as among those which were destroyed by the
Normans, and rebuilt by the zeal of good princes. They also alleged
the dispute that prevailed under the Norman dukes for more than two
hundred years, between this convent and that of F&eacute;camp,
respecting the right of nominating one of their own brethren to the
head of their community, a right which was claimed by
F&eacute;camp; and they displayed the series of their prelates,
continued in an uninterrupted line from the time of their founder.
Whatever may have been the justice of these claims, the antiquity
of the monastery is admitted by all parties.--Its monks, like
those of the abbey of St. Ouen, had the privilege of receiving
every new bishop of the see, on the first day of his arrival at
Evreux; and his corpse was deposited in their church, where the
funeral obsequies were performed. This privilege, originally
intended only as a mark of distinction to the abbey, was on two
occasions perverted to a purpose that might scarcely have been
expected. Upon the death of Bishop John d'Aubergenville in 1256,
the monks resented the reformation which he had endeavoured to
introduce into their order, by refusing to admit his body within
their precinct; and though fined for their obstinacy, they did not
learn wisdom by experience, but forty-three years afterwards shewed
their hostility decidedly towards the remains of Geoffrey of Bar,
<a name="Page_76"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;76]</span></a>a
still more determined reformer of monastic abuses. Extreme was the
licentiousness which prevailed in those days among the monks of St.
Taurinus, and unceasing were the endeavors of the bishop to correct
them. The contest continued during his life, at the close of which
they not only shut their doors against his corpse, but dragged it
from the coffin and gave it a public flagellation. So gross an act
of indecency would in all probability be classed among the many
scandalous tales invented of ecclesiastics, but that the judicial
proceedings which ensued leave no doubt of its truth; and it was
even recorded in the burial register of the cathedral.</p>

<p>The church of St. Taurinus offers some valuable specimens of
ancient architecture.--The southern transept still preserves a
row of Norman arches, running along the lower part of its west
side, as well as along its front; but those above them are pointed.
To the south are six circular arches, divided into two
compartments, in each of which the central arch has formerly served
for a window. Both the lateral ones are filled with coeval
stone-work, whose face is carved into lozenges, which were
alternately coated with blue and red mortar or stucco: distinct
traces of the coloring are still left in the cavities<a name="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>. To the
eastern side of this transept is attached, as at St. Georges, a
small chapel, of semi-circular architecture, now greatly in ruins.
The interior of the church is all comparatively modern, with the
exception of some of <a name="Page_77"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;77]</span></a>the lower arches on the north
side.--A strange and whimsical vessel for holy water attracted
our attention. I cannot venture to guess at its date, but I do not
think it is more recent than the fourteenth century.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_12"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_12.png" height="299" width="313" alt="Vessel for holy water" /></p>

<p>The principal curiosity of the church, and indeed of the town,
is the shrine, which contained, or perhaps, contains, a portion of
the bones of the patron saint, whose body, after having continued
for more than three hundred years a hidden treasure, was at last
revealed in a miraculous manner to the prayers of Landulphus, one
of his successors in the episcopacy.--The cathedral of
Chartres, in early ages, set up a rival claim for the possession <a
name="Page_78"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;78]</span></a>of
this precious relic; but its existence here was formally verified
at the end of the seventeenth century, by the opening of the
<i>châsse</i>, in which a small quantity of bones was found
tied up in a leather bag, with a certificate of their authenticity,
signed by an early bishop.--The shrine is of silver-gilt,
about one and a half foot in height and two feet in length: it is a
fine specimen of ancient art. In shape it resembles the nave of a
church, with the sides richly enchased with figures of saints and
bishops. Our curious eyes would fain have pried within; but it was
closed with the impression of the archbishop's signet.--A
crypt, the original burial place of St. Taurinus, is still shewn in
the church, and it continues to be the object of great veneration.
It is immediately in front of the high altar, and is entered by two
staircases, one at the head, the other at the foot of the coffin.
The vault is very small, only admitting of the coffin and of a
narrow passage by its side. The sarcophagus, which is extremely
shallow, and neither wide nor long, is partly imbedded in the wall,
so that the head and foot and one side alone are visible.--A
portion of the monastic buildings of St. Taurinus now serves as a
seminary for the catholic priesthood.</p>

<p>The west front of the church of St. Giles is not devoid of
interest. Many other churches here have been desecrated; and this
ancient building has been converted into a stable. The door-way is
formed by a fine semi-circular arch, ornamented with the
chevron-moulding, disposed in a triple row, and with a line of
quatrefoils along the archivolt. Both these decorations are
singular: I recollect <a name="Page_79"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;79]</span></a>no other instance of the
quatrefoil being employed in an early Norman building, though
immediately upon the adoption of the pointed style it became
exceedingly common; nor can I point out another example of the
chevron-moulding thus disposed. It produces a better effect than
when arranged in detached bands. The capitals to the pillars of the
arch are sculptured with winged dragons and other animals, in bold
relief.</p>

<p>These are the only worthy objects of architectural inquiry now
existing in the city. Many must have been destroyed by the ravages
of war, and by the excesses of the revolution.--Evreux
therefore does not abound with memorials of its antiquity. But its
existence as a town, during the period of the domination of the
Romans, rests upon authority that is scarcely questionable. It has
been doubted whether the present city, or a village about three
miles distant, known by the name of <i>Old Evreux</i>, is the
<i>Mediolanum Aulercorum</i> of Ptolemy. His description is given
with sufficient accuracy to exclude the pretensions of any other
town, though not with such a degree of precision as will enable us,
after a lapse of sixteen centuries, to decide between the claims of
the two sites. C&aelig;sar, in his <i>Commentaries</i>, speaks in
general terms of the <i>Aulerci Eburovices</i>, who are admitted to
have been the ancient inhabitants of this district, and whose name,
especially as modified to <i>Ebroici</i> and <i>Ebroi</i>, is
clearly to be recognized in that of the county. The foundations of
ancient buildings are still to be seen at Old Evreux; and various
coins and medals of the upper empire, have at different times been
dug up within its precincts. Hence it has been concluded, that the
<a name="Page_80"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;80]</span></a><i>Mediolanum Aulercorum</i> was
situated there. The supporters of the contrary opinion admit that
Old Evreux was a Roman station; but they say that, considering its
size, it can have been no more than an encampment: they also
maintain, that a castle was subsequently built upon the site of
this encampment, by Richard, Count of Evreux, and that the
destruction of this castle, during the Norman wars, gave rise to
the ruins now visible, which in their turn were the cause of the
name of the village<a name="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It is certain that, in the reign of William the Conqueror, the
town stood in its present situation: Ordericus Vitalis speaks in
terms that admit of no hesitation, when he states that, in the year
1080, "fides Christi Evanticorum, id est Evroas, urbem, <i>super
Ittonum fluvium sitam</i> possidebat et salubrit&egrave;r
illuminabat<a name="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>."</p>

<p>In the times of Norman sovereignty, Evreux attained an
unfortunate independence: Duke Richard Ist severed it from the
duchy, and erected it into a distinct earldom in favor of Robert,
his second son. From him the inheritance descended to Richard and
William, his son and grandson; after whose death, it fell into the
female line, and passed into the house of Montfort d'Amaury, by the
marriage of Agnes, sister of Richard of Evreux.--Nominally
independent, but really held only at the pleasure of the Dukes of
Normandy, the rank of the earldom occasioned the misery of the
inhabitants, who were continually involved in warfare, and
plundered by conflicting parties. The annals of Evreux contain the
<a name="Page_81"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;81]</span></a>relation of a series of events,
full of interest and amusement to us who peruse them; but those,
who lived at the time when these events were really acted, might
exclaim, like the frogs in the fable, "that what is entertainment
to us, was death to them."--At length, the treaty of Louviers,
in 1195, altered the aspect of affairs. The King of France gained
the right of placing a garrison in Evreux; and, five years
afterwards, he obtained a formal cession of the earldom. Philip
Augustus took possession of the city, to the great joy of the
inhabitants, who, six years before, had seen their town pillaged,
and their houses destroyed, by the orders of this monarch. The
severity exercised upon that occasion had been excessive; but
Philip's indignation had been roused by one of the basest acts of
treachery recorded in history.--John, faithless at every
period of his life, had entered into a treaty with the French
monarch, during the captivity of his brother, Coeur-de-Lion, to
deliver up Normandy; and Philip, conformably with this plan, was
engaged in reducing the strong holds upon the frontiers, whilst his
colleague resided at Evreux. The unexpected release of the English
king disconcerted these intrigues; and John, alarmed at the course
which he had been pursuing, thought only how to avert the anger of
his offended sovereign. Under pretence, therefore, of shewing
hospitality to the French, he invited the principal officers to a
feast, where he caused them all to be murdered; and he afterwards
put the rest of the garrison to the sword.--Brito records the
transaction in the following lines, which I quote, not only as an
historical document, illustrative of the moral character of one of
the worst sovereigns that ever swayed the British <a name="Page_82"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;82]</span></a>sceptre,
but as an honorable testimony to the memory of his unfortunate
brother:--</p>

<p>The vicissitudes to which the county of Evreux was doomed to be
subject, did not wholly cease upon its annexation to the crown of
France. It passed, in the fourteenth century, into the hands of the
Kings of Navarre, <a name="Page_83"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;83]</span></a>so as to form a portion of their
foreign territory; and early in the fifteenth, it fell by right of
conquest under English sovereignty.--Philip the Bold conferred
it, in 1276, upon Louis, his youngest son; and from him descended
the line of Counts of Evreux, who, originating in the royal family
of France, became Kings of Navarre. The kingdom was brought into
the family by the marriage of Philip Count of Evreux with Jane
daughter of Louis Hutin, King of France and Navarre, to whom she
succeeded as heir general. Charles IIIrd, of Navarre, ceded Evreux
by treaty to his namesake, Charles VIth of France, in 1404; and he
shortly after bestowed it upon John Stuart, Lord of Aubigni, and
Constable of Scotland.--Under Henry Vth, our countrymen took
the city in 1417, but we were not long allowed to hold undisturbed
possession of it; for, in 1424, it was recaptured by the French.
Their success, however, was only ephemeral: the battle of Verneuil
replaced Evreux in the power of the English before the expiration
of the same year; and we kept it till 1441, when the garrison was
surprised, and the town lost, though not without a vigorous
resistance.--Towards the close of the following century, the
earldom was raised into a <i>Duch&eacute; pairie</i>, by Charles
IXth, who, having taken the lordship of Gisors from his brother,
the Duc d'Alen&ccedil;on, better known by his subsequent title of
Duc d'Anjou, recompenced him by a grant of Evreux. Upon the death
of this prince without issue, in 1584, Evreux reverted to the
crown, and the title lay dormant till 1652, when Louis XIVth
exchanged the earldom with the Duc de Bouillon, in return for the
principality of Sedan. In his family it remained till the
revolution, <a name="Page_84"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;84]</span></a>which, amalgamating the whole of
France into one common mass of equal rights and laws, put an end to
all local privileges and other feudal tenures.</p>

<p>Evreux, at present, is a town containing about eight thousand
inhabitants, a great proportion of whom are persons of independent
property, or <i>rentiers</i>, as the French call them. Hence it has
an air of elegance, seldom to be found in a commercial, and never
in a manufacturing town; and to us this appearance was the more
striking, as being the first instance of the kind we had seen in
Normandy. The streets are broad and beautifully neat. The city
stands in the midst of gardens and orchards, in a fertile valley,
watered by the Iton, and inclosed towards the north and south by
ranges of hills. The river divides into two branches before it
reaches the town, both which flow on the outside of the walls. But,
besides these, a portion of its waters has been conducted through
the centre of the city, by means of a canal dug by the order of
Jane of Navarre. This Iton, like the Mole, in Kent, suddenly loses
itself in the ground, near the little town of Damville, about
twenty miles south of Evreux, and holds its subterranean course for
nearly two miles. A similar phenomenon is observable with a
neighboring stream, the Risle, between Ferri&egrave;re and
Grammont<a name="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>: in both cases it is attributed,
I know not with what justice, to an abrupt change in the
stratification of the soil.</p>

curious transaction, which took place in the year 1119, is related
with considerable <i>n&auml;ivet&eacute;</i> by Ordericus Vitalis,
p. 852, as follows:--"Henricus Rex rebellibus ultr&agrave;

impugnare coepit. Sed oppidanis, qui intrinsecus erant, cum civibus
viriliter repugnantibus, introire nequivit. Erant cum illo Ricardus

maxima vis Normannorum. Quibus ante Regem convocatis in unnm, Rex
dixit ad Audinum Episcopum. "Videsne, domine Pr&aelig;sul,

<p><a name="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor40">[40]</a> This
was not the first, nor the only, contest, which was fought by
Taurinus with Satan. Their struggles began at the moment of the
saint's coming to Evreux, and did not even terminate when his life
was ended. But the devil was, by the power of his adversary,
brought to such a helpless state, that, though he continued to
haunt the city, where the people knew him by the name of
<i>Gobelinus</i>, he was unable to injure any one.--All this
is seriously related by Ordericus Vitalis, (p. 555.) from whom I
extract the following passage, in illustration of what Evreux was
supposed to owe to its first bishop.--"Grassante secundâ

<h4>VICINITY OF EVREUX--CH&Acirc;TEAU DE
NAVARRE--COCHEREL--PONT-AUDEMER
--MONTFORT-SUR-RISLE--HARFLEUR--BOURG-ACHARD--FRENCH
WEDDING.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Bourg-Achard, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Evreux is seldom visited by the English; and none of our
numerous absentees have thought fit to settle here, though the
other parts of Normandy are filled with families who are suffering
under the sentence of self-banishment. It is rather surprising,
that this town has not obtained its share of English settlers: the
air is good, provisions are cheap, and society is agreeable. Those,
too, if such there be, who are attracted by historical
reminiscences, will find themselves on historical ground.</p>

<p>The premier viscount of the British parliament derives his name
from Evreux; though, owing to a slight alteration in spelling and
to our peculiar pronunciation, it has now become so completely
anglicised, that few persons, without reflection, would recognize a
descendant of the Comtes d'Evreux, in Henry Devereux, Viscount of
Hereford. The Norman origin of this family is admitted by the
genealogists and heralds, both of France and of England; and the
fate of the Earl of Essex is invariably introduced in the works of
those authors, who have written upon Evreux or its honors.</p>

<p>It would have been unpardonable to have quitted Evreux, without
rambling to the Château de Navarre, which is not more than a
mile and half distant from <a name="Page_86"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;86]</span></a>the town.--This
Château, whose name recals an interesting period in the
history of the earldom, was originally a royal residence. It was
erected in the middle of the fourteenth century by Jane of France,
who, with a very pardonable vanity, directed her new palace to be
called Navarre, that her Norman subjects might never forget that
she was herself a queen, and that she had brought a kingdom as a
marriage portion to her husband. Her son, Charles the Bad, a prince
whose turbulent and evil disposition caused so much misfortune to
France, was born here. Happy too had it been for him, had he here
closed his eyes before he entered upon the wider theatre of the
world! During his early days passed at Navarre, he is said to have
shewn an ingenuousness of disposition and some traits of
generosity, which gave rise to hopes that were miserably falsified
by his future life.--The present edifice, however, a modern
French Château, retains nothing more than the name of the
structure which was built by the queen, and which was levelled with
the ground, in the year 1686, by the Duc de Bouillon, the lord of
the country, who erected the present mansion. His descendants
resided here till the revolution, at which time they emigrated, and
the estate became national property. It remained for a considerable
period unoccupied, and was at last granted to Jos&eacute;phine, by
her imperial husband. At present, the domain belongs to her son,
Prince Eugene, by whom the house has lately been stripped of its
furniture. Many of the fine trees in the park have also been cut
down, and the whole appears neglected and desolate. His mother did
not like Navarre: <a name="Page_87"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;87]</span></a>he himself never saw it: the
queen of Holland alone used occasionally to reside here.--The
principal beauty of the place lies in its woods; and these we saw
to the greatest advantage. It was impossible for earth or sky to
look more lovely.--The house is of stone, with large windows;
and an ill-shaped dome rises in the centre. The height of the
building is somewhat greater than its width, which makes it appear
top-heavy; and every thing about it is formal; but the noble
avenue, the terrace-steps, great lanthorns, iron gates, and sheets
of water on either side of the approach, are upon an extensive
scale, and in a fine baronial style.--Yet, still they are
inferior to the accompaniments of the same nature which are found
about many noblemen's residences in England.--The hall, which
is spacious, has a striking effect, being open to the dome. Its
sides are painted with military trophies, and with the warlike
instruments of the four quarters of the globe. We saw nothing else
in the house worthy of notice. It is merely a collection of
apartments of moderate size; and, empty and dirty as they were,
they appeared to great disadvantage. In the midst of the solitude
of desolation, some ordinary portraits of the Bouillon family still
remain upon the walls, as if in mockery of departed greatness.</p>

<p>We were unable to direct our course to Cocherel, a village about
sixteen miles distant, on the road to Vernon, celebrated as the
spot where a battle was fought, in the fourteenth century, between
the troops of Navarre, and those of France, commanded by Du
Guesclin.--I notice this place, because it is possible that,
if excavations were made there, those antiquaries who delight in
relics of the <a name="Page_88"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;88]</span></a>remotest age of European
history, might win many prizes. A tomb of great curiosity was
discovered in the year 1685; and celts, and stone hatchets, and
other implements, belonging, as it is presumed, to the original
inhabitants of the country, have been found beneath the soil. Many
of these are described and figured by the Abb&eacute; de Cocherel,
in a paper full of curious erudition, subjoined to Le Brasseur's
<i>History of Evreux</i>. The hatchets resembled those frequently
dug up in England; but they were more perfect, inasmuch as some of
them were fastened in deers' horns, and had handles attached to
them; thus clearly indicating the manner in which they were
used.--The place of burial differed, I believe, in its
internal arrangement from any sepulchral monument, whether
Cromlech, Carnedd, or Barrow, that has been opened in our own
country. Three sides of it were rudely faced with large stones:
within were contained about twenty skeletons, lying in a row, close
to each other, north and south, their arms pressed to their sides.
The head of each individual rested on a stone, fashioned with care,
but to no certain pattern. Some were fusiform, others wedge-shaped,
and others irregularly oblong. In general, the stones did not
appear to be the production of the country. One was oriental jade,
another German agate. In the tomb were also a few cinerary urns;
whence it appears that the people, by whom it was constructed, were
of a nation that was at once in the habit of burning, and of
interring, their dead. From these facts, the Abb&eacute; finds room
for much ingenious conjecture; and, after discussing the relative
probabilities of the sepulchre having been a burying-place of the
Gauls, the Jews, the <a name="Page_89"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;89]</span></a>Druids, the Normans, or the
Huns, he decides, though with some hesitation, in favor of the last
of these opinions.</p>

<p>From Evreux we went by Brionne to Pont-Audemer: at first the
road is directed through an open country, without beauty or
interest; but the prospect improved upon us when we joined the
rapid sparkling <i>Risle</i>, which waters a valley of great
richness, bounded on either side by wooded hills.--Of Brionne
itself I shall soon have a better opportunity of speaking; as we
purpose stopping there on our way to Caen.</p>

<p>A few miles before Brionne, we passed Harcourt, the ancient
barony of the noble family still flourishing in England, and
existing in France. It is a small country town, remarkable only for
some remains of a castle<a name="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>, built by Robert de Harcourt,
fifth in descent from Bernard the Dane, chief counsellor, and
second in command to Rollo. The blood of the Dane is in the present
earl of Harcourt: he traces his lineage in a direct line from
Robert, the builder of the castle, who accompanied the Conqueror
into England, and fell in battle by his side.</p>

<p>Pont-Audemer is a small, neat, country town, situated upon the
Risle, which here, within ten miles of its junction with the Seine,
is enlarged into a river of considerable magnitude. But its
channel, in the immediate vicinity of the town, divides into
several small streams; and thus it loses much of its dignity,
though the change is highly advantageous to picturesque beauty, and
to the conveniences of trade. Mills stand on some of these streams,
but most of them are applied to the purposes of tanning; for
leather is the staple manufacture of the place, <a name="Page_90"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;90]</span></a>and the
hides prepared at Pont-Audemer are thought to be the best in
France.</p>

<p>From Brionne the valley of the Risle preserves a width of about
a mile, or a mile and half: at Pont-Audemer it becomes somewhat
narrower, and the town stretches immediately across it, instead of
being built along the banks of the river.--The inhabitants are
thus enabled to avail themselves of the different streams which
intersect it.</p>

<p>Tradition refers the origin, as well as the name of
Pont-Audemer, to a chief, called Aldemar or Odomar, who ruled over
a portion of Gaul in the fifth century, and who built a bridge
here.--These legendary heroes abound in topography, but it is
scarcely worth while to discuss their existence. In Norman times
Pont-Audemer was a military station. The nobility of the province,
always turbulent, but never more so than during the reign of Henry
Ist, had availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by the
absence of the monarch, and by his domestic misfortunes, to take up
arms in the cause of the son of Robert. Henry landed at the mouth
of the Seine, and it was at Pont-Audemer that the first conflict
took place between him and his rebellious subjects. The latter were
defeated, and the fortress immediately surrendered; but, in the
early part of the fourteenth century, it appears to have been of
greater strength: it had been ceded by King John of France to the
Count of Evreux, and it resisted all the efforts of its former lord
during a siege of six weeks, at the end of which time his generals
were obliged to retire, with the loss of their military engines and
artillery. This siege is memorable in history, as the <a name="Page_91"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;91]</span></a>first in
which it is known that cannon were employed in
France.--Pont-Audemer, still in possession of the kings of
Navarre, withstood a second siege, towards the conclusion of the
same century, but with less good fortune than before. It was taken
by the constable Du Guesclin, and, according to Froissart<a name="FNanchor48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>, "the
castle was razed to the ground, though it had cost large sums to
erect; and the walls and towers of the town were destroyed."</p>

<p>St. Ouen, the principal church in the place, is a poor edifice.
It bears, however, some tokens of remote age: such are the circular
arches in the choir, and a curious capital, on which are
represented two figures in combat, of rude sculpture.--A
second church, that of Notre Dame des Pr&eacute;s, now turned into
a tan-house, exhibits an architectural feature which is altogether
novel. Over the great entrance, it has a string-course, apparently
intended to represent a corbel-table, though it does not support
any superior member; and the intermediate spaces between the
corbels, instead of being left blank, as usual, are filled with
sculptured stones, which project considerably, though less than the
corbels with which they alternate. There is something of the same
kind, but by no means equally remarkable, over the arcades above
the west door-way of Castle-Acre Priory<a name="FNanchor49"></a><a
href="#Footnote_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>. Neither Mr. Cotman's
memory, nor my own, will furnish another example.--The church
of Notre Dame des Pr&eacute;s is of the period when the pointed
style was beginning to be employed. The exterior is considerably
injured: to the interior we could not obtain admission.</p>

<p><a name="Page_92"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;92]</span></a></p>
<p>The suburbs of Pont-Audemer furnish another church dedicated to
St. Germain, which would have been an excellent subject for both
pen and pencil, had it undergone less alteration. The short, thick,
square, central tower has, on each side, a row of four windows, of
nearly the earliest pointed style; many of the windows of the body
of the church have semi-circular heads; the corbels which extend in
a line round the nave and transepts are strangely grotesque; and,
on the north side of the eastern extremity, is a semi-circular
chapel, as at St. Georges.--The inside is dark and gloomy, the
floor unpaved, and every thing in and about it in a state of utter
neglect, except some dozen saints, all in the gayest attire, and
covered with artificial flowers. The capitals of the columns are in
the true Norman style. Those at St. Georges are scarcely more
fantastic, or more monstrous.--Between two of the arches of
the choir, on the south side of this church, is the effigy of a man
in his robes, coifed with a close cap, lying on an altar-tomb. The
figure is much mutilated; but the style of the canopy-work over the
head indicates that it is not of great antiquity. The feet of the
statue rest upon a dog, who is busily occupied in gnawing a
marrow-bone.--Dogs at the base of monumental effigies are
common, and they have been considered as symbols of fidelity and
honor; but surely the same is not intended to be typified by a dog
thus employed; and it is not likely that his being so is a mere
caprice of the sculptor's.--There is no inscription upon the
monument; nor could we learn whom it is intended to
commemorate.</p>

<p>At but a short distance from Pont-Audemer, higher up the Risle,
lies the yet smaller town of Montfort, near <a name="Page_93"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;93]</span></a>which are still to be
traced, the ruins of a castle,<a name="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> memorable for the thirty days'
siege, which it supported from the army of Henry Ist, in 1122; and
dismantled by Charles Vth, at the same time that he razed the
fortifications of Pont-Audemer. The Baron of Montfort yet ranks in
our peerage; though I am not aware that the nobleman, who at
present bears the title, boasts a descent from any part of the
family of <i>Hugh with a beard</i>, the owner of Montfort at the
time of the conquest, and one of the Conqueror's attendants at the
battle of Hastings.</p>

<p>From Pont-Audemer we proceeded to Honfleur: it was market-day at
the place which we had quitted, and the throng of persons who
passed us on the road, gave great life and variety to the scene.
There was scarcely an individual from whom we did not receive a
friendly smile or nod, accompanied by a <i>bon jour</i>; for the
practice obtains commonly in France, among the peasants, of
saluting those whom they consider their superiors. Almost all that
were going to market, whether male or female, were mounted on
horses or asses; and their fruit, vegetables, butchers' meat, live
fowls, and live sheep, were indiscriminately carried in the same
way.</p>

<p>About a league before we arrived at Honfleur, a distant view of
the eastern banks of the river opened upon us from the summit of a
hill, and we felt, or fancied that we felt, "the air freshened from
the wave." As we descended, the ample Seine, here not less than
nine miles in width, suddenly displayed itself, and we had not gone
far before we came in sight of Honfleur. The mist <a name="Page_94"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;94]</span></a>occasioned
by the intense heat, prevented us from seeing distinctly the
opposite towns of Havre and Harfleur: we could only just discern
the spire of the latter, and the long projecting line of the piers
and fortifications of Havre. The great river rolls majestically
into the British Channel between these two points, and forms the
bay of Honfleur. About four miles higher up the stream where it
narrows, the promontories of Quilleboeuf and of Tancarville close
the prospect.--Honfleur itself is finely situated: valleys,
full of meadows of the liveliest green, open to the Seine in the
immediate vicinity of the town; and the hills with which it is
backed are beautifully clothed with foliage to the very edge of the
water. The trees, far from being stunted and leafless, as on the
eastern coast of England, appear as if they were indebted to their
situation for a verdure of unusual luxuriancy. A similar line of
hills borders the Seine on either side, as far as the eye can
reach.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for us, that we entered the town at low
water, when the empty harbor and slimy river could scarcely fail to
prepossess us unfavorably. The quays are faced with stone, and the
two basins are fine works, and well adapted for commerce. This part
of Honfleur reminded us of Dieppe; but the houses, though equally
varied in form and materials, are not equally handsome.--Still
less so are the churches; and a picturesque castle is wholly
wanting.--In the principal object of my journey to Honfleur,
my expectations were completely frustrated. I had been told at
Rouen, that I should here find a very ancient wooden church, and
our imagination <a name="Page_95"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;95]</span></a>had pictured to us one equally
remarkable as that of Greensted, in Essex, and probably constructed
in the same manner, of massy trunks of trees. With the usual
anticipation of an antiquary, I imagined that I should discover a
parallel to that most singular building; which, as every body
knows, is one of the greatest architectural curiosities in England.
But, alas! I was sadly disappointed. The wooden church of Honfleur,
so old in the report of my informant, is merely a thing of
yesterday, certainly not above two hundred and fifty years of age;
and, though it is undeniably of wood, within and without, the walls
are made, as in most of the houses in the town, of a timber frame
filled with clay. There is another church in Honfleur, but it was
equally without interest. Thus baffled, we walked to the heights
above the town: at the top of the cliff was a crowd of people, some
of them engaged in devotion near a large wooden crucifix, others
enjoying themselves at different games, or sitting upon the neat
stone benches, which are scattered plentifully about the walks in
this charming situation. The neighboring little chapel of Notre
Dame de Grace is regarded as a building of great sanctity, and is
especially resorted to by sailors, a class of people who are
superstitious, all the world over. It abounds with their votive
tablets. From the roof and walls</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>"Pendono intorno in lungo ordine i voti,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Che vi portaro i creduli divoti."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among the pictures, we counted nineteen, commemorative of escape
from shipwreck, all of them painted after precisely the same
pattern: a stormy sea, a vessel in <a name="Page_96"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;96]</span></a>distress, and the Virgin holding
the infant Savior in her arms, appearing through a black cloud in
the corner,--In the Catholic ritual, the holy Virgin, is
termed <i>Maris Stella</i>, and she is &kappa;&alpha;&tau;'
&epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&eta;&nu; [English. Not in Original:
pre-eminently, especially, above all] the protectress of
Normandy.</p>

<p>Honfleur is still a fortified town; but it does not appear a
place of much strength, nor is it important in any point of view.
Its trade is inconsiderable, and its population does not amount to
nine thousand inhabitants. But in the year 1450, while in the hands
of our countrymen, it sustained a siege of a month's duration from
the king of France; and, in the following century, it had the
distinction, attended with but little honor, of being the last
place in the kingdom that held out for the league.</p>

<p>From Honfleur we would fain have returned by Sanson-sur-Risle
and Foullebec, at both which villages M. Le Prevost had led us to
expect curious churches; but our postillion assured us that the
roads were wholly impassable. We were therefore compelled to allow
Mr. Cotman to visit them alone, while we retraced a portion of our
steps through the valley of the Risle, and then took an eastern
direction to Bourg-Achard in our way to Rouen.</p>

<p>Bourg-Achard was the seat of an abbey, built by the monks of
Falaise, in 1143: it was originally dedicated to St. L&ocirc;; but
St. Eustatius, the favorite saint of this part of the country,
afterwards became its patron. Before the revolution, his skull was
preserved in the sacristy of the convent, enchased in a bust of
silver gilt<a name="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>; and even now, when the relic
has been <a name="Page_97"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;97]</span></a>consigned to its kindred dust,
and the shrine to the furnace, and the abbey has been levelled with
the ground, there remains in the parochial church a fragment of
sculpture, which evidently represented the miracle that led to
Eustatius' conversion.--The knight, indeed, is gone, and the
cross has disappeared from between the horns of the stag; but the
horse and the deer, are left, and their position indicates the
legend.--The church of Bourg-Achard has been materially
injured. The whole of the building, from the transept westward, has
been taken down; but it deserves a visit, if only as retaining a
<i>b&eacute;nitier</i> of ancient form and workmanship, and a
leaden font. Of the latter, I send you a drawing. Leaden fonts are
of very rare occurrence in England<a name="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>, and I never saw or heard of
another such in France: indeed, a baptismal font of any kind is
seldom to be seen in a French church, and the vessels used for
containing the holy water, are in most cases nothing more than
small basins in the form of escalop shells, affixed to the wall, or
to some pillar near the entrance.--It is possible that the <a
name="Page_98"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;98]</span></a>fonts
were removed and sold during the revolution, as they were in our
own country, by the ordinance of the houses of parliament, after
the deposition of Charles Ist; but this is a mere conjecture on my
own part. It is also possible that they may be kept in the
sacristy, where I have certainly seen them in some cases. In
earlier times, they not only existed in every church, but were
looked upon with superstitious reverence. They are frequently
mentioned in the decrees of ecclesiastical councils; some of which
provide for keeping them clean and locked; others for consigning
the keys of them to proper officers; others direct that they should
never be without water; and others that nothing profane should be
laid upon them<a name="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_35"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_35.png" height="411" width="474" alt="Leaden Font at Bourg-Achard" /></p>

<p>As we were at breakfast this morning, a procession, attended by
a great throng, passed our windows, and we were invited by our
landlady to go to the church and see the wedding of two of the
principal persons of the parish, We accepted the proposal; and,
though the same ceremony has been witnessed by thousands of
Englishmen, yet I doubt whether it has been described by any
one.--The bride was a girl of very interesting appearance,
dressed wholly in white: even her shoes were white, and a bouquet
of white roses, jessamine, and orange-flowers, was placed in her
bosom.--The mayor of the town conducted her to the altar.
Previously to the commencement of the service, the priest stated
aloud that the forms required by law, for what is termed the civil
marriage, had been completed. It was highly necessary that he
should do so; for, according to the present code, a <a name="Page_99"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;99]</span></a>minister
of any persuasion, who proceeds to the religious ceremonies of
marriage before the parties have been married by the magistrate, is
subject to very heavy penalties, to imprisonment, and to
transportation. Indeed, going to church at all for the purpose of
marriage, is quite a work of supererogation, and may be omitted or
not, just as the parties please; the law requiring no other proof
of a marriage, beyond the certificate recorded in the municipal
registry. After this most important preliminary, the priest
exhorted every one present, under pain of excommunication, to
declare if they knew of any impediment: this, however, was merely
done for the purpose of keeping up the dignity of the church, for
the knot was already tied as fast as it ever could be. He then read
a discourse upon the sanctity of the marriage compact, and the
excellence of the wedded state among the Catholics, compared to
what prevailed formerly among the Jews and Heathens, who degraded
it by frequent divorces and licentiousness. The parties now
declared their mutual consent, and his reverence enjoined each to
be to the other "comme un &eacute;poux fid&egrave;le et de lui
tenir fid&eacute;lit&eacute; en toutes choses."--The ring was
presented to the minister by one of the acolytes, upon a gold
plate; and, before he directed the bridegroom to place it upon the
finger of the lady, he desired him to observe that it was a symbol
of marriage.--During the whole of the service two other
acolytes were stationed in front of the bride and bridegroom, each
holding in his hands a lighted taper; and near the conclusion,
while they knelt before the altar, a pall of flowered brocade was
<a name="Page_100"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;100]</span></a>stretched behind them, as
emblematic of their union. Holy water was not forgotten; for, in
almost every rite of the Catholic church, the mystic sanctification
by water and by fire continually occurs.--The ceremony ended
by the priest's receiving the sacrament himself, but without
administering it to any other individual present. Having taken it,
he kissed the paten which had contained the holy elements, and all
the party did the same: each, too, in succession, put a piece of
money into a cup, to which we also were invited to contribute, for
the love of the Holy Virgin.--They entered by the south door,
but the great western portal was thrown open as they left the
church; and by that they departed.</p>

<h4>MOULINEAUX--CASTLE OF ROBERT THE
DEVIL--BOURG-THEROUDE--ABBEY OF BEC--BRIONNE.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Brionne, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Having accomplished the objects which we had proposed to
ourselves in Rouen and its vicinity, we set out this morning upon
our excursion to the western parts of the province. Our first
stage, to Moulineaux, was by the same road by which we returned a
few days ago from Bourg-Achard. It is a delightful ride, through
the valley of the Seine, here of great width, stretching to our
left in an uninterrupted course of flat open country, but, on our
right hand, bordered at no great distance by the ridge of steep
chalky cliffs which line the bank of the river. The road appears to
have been a work of considerable labor: it is every where raised,
and in some places as high as fifteen feet above the level of the
fields on either side.--Agriculture in this district is
conducted, as about Paris, upon the plan called by the French <i>la
petite culture</i>: the fields are all divided into narrow strips;
so that a piece of not more than two or three acres, frequently
produces eight or ten different crops, some of grain, others of
culinary vegetables, at the same time that many of these portions
are planted with apple and cherry trees. The land is all open and
uninclosed: not a fence is to be seen; nor do there even appear to
be any balks or head-marks. Strangers therefore who come, like us,
from a country entirely inclosed, cannot refrain <a name="Page_102"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;102]</span></a>from
frequent expressions of surprise how it is that every person here
is enabled to tell the limits of his own property.</p>

<p>Moulineaux is a poor village, a mere assemblage of cottages,
with mud walls and thatched roofs. But the church is interesting,
though desecrated and verging to ruin. Even now the outside alone
is entire. The interior is gutted and in a state of absolute
neglect.--The building is of the earliest pointed style: its
lancet-windows are of the plainest kind, being destitute of side
pillars: in some of the windows are still remains of handsome
painted glass.--Either the antiquaries in France are more
honest than in England, or they want taste, or objects of this kind
do not find a ready market. We know too well how many an English
church, albeit well guarded by the churchwardens and the parson,
has seen its windows despoiled of every shield, and saint, and
motto; and we also know full well, by whom, and for whom, such
ravages are committed. In France, on the contrary, where painted
glass still fills the windows of sacred buildings, now employed for
the meanest purposes, or wholly deserted, no one will even take the
trouble of carrying it away; and the storied panes are left, as
derelicts utterly without value.--The east end of the church
at Moulineaux is semi-circular; the roof is of stone, handsomely
groined, and the groinings spring from fanciful corbels. On either
side of the nave, near the choir, is a recess in the wall, carved
with tabernacle-work, and serving for a piscina. Recesses of this
kind, though of frequent occurrence in English churches, do not
often appear in France. Still less common are those elaborate <a

richly gilt or gorgeously painted, which separate the nave from the
chancel in the churches of many of our smaller villages at home.
The only one I ever recollect to have seen in France was at
Moulineaux.--I also observed a mutilated pillar, which
originally supported the altar, ornamented with escalop shells and
fleurs-de-lys in bold relief. It reminded me of one figured in the
<i>Antiquarian Repertory</i>, from Harold's chapel, in Battle
Abbey<a name="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving Moulineaux, the road winds along the
base of a steep chalk hill, whose brow is crowned by the remains of
the famous castle of Robert the Devil, the father of Richard
Fearnought. Robert the Devil is a mighty hero of romance; but there
is some difficulty in discovering his historical prototype. Could
we point out his <i>gestes</i> in the chronicle, they would hardly
outvalue his adventures, as they are recorded in the nursery tale.
Robert haunts this castle, which appears to have been of great
extent, though its ruins are very indistinct. The walls on the
southern side are rents, and covered with brush-wood; and no
architectural feature is discernible. Wide and deep fosses encircle
the site, which is undermined by spacious crypts and subterraneous
caverns.--The fortress is evidently of remote, but uncertain,
antiquity: it was dismantled by King John when he abandoned the
duchy. The historians of Normandy say that it was re-fortified
during the civil wars; <a name="Page_104"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;104]</span></a>and the fact is not destitute
of probability, as its position is bold and commanding.</p>

<p>Bourg-Theroude, our next stage, is one of those places which are
indebted to their names alone for the little importance they
possess. At present, it is a small assemblage of mean houses, most
of them inns; but its Latin appellation, <i>Burgus Thuroldi</i>,
commemorates no less a personage than one of the preceptors of
William the Conqueror, and his grand constable at the time when he
effected the conquest of England.--The name of Turold occurs
upon the Bayeux tapestry, designating one of the ambassadors
dispatched by the Norman Duke to Guy, Earl of Ponthieu; and it is
supposed that the Turold there represented was the grand
constable<a name="FNanchor55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>.--The church of
Bourg-Theroude, <a name="Page_105"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;105]</span></a>which was collegiate before the
revolution, is at present uninteresting in every point of view.</p>

<p>About half way from this place to Brionne, we came in sight of
the remains of the celebrated abbey of Bec, situated a mile and
half or two miles distant to our right, at the extremity of a
beautiful valley. We had been repeatedly assured that scarcely one
stone of this formerly magnificent building was left upon another;
but it would have shewn an unpardonable want of curiosity to have
passed so near without visiting it: even to stand upon the spot
which such a monastery originally covered is a privilege not
lightly to be foregone:--</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>And <i>happiness</i> of this kind would on such an occasion

<p><a name="Page_106"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;106]</span></a></p>
<p>As usual, the accounts which we had received proved incorrect.
The greater part of the conventual edifice still exists, but it has
no kind of architectural value. Some detached portions, whose
original use it would be difficult now to conjecture, appear, from
their wide pointed windows, to be of the fifteenth century. The
other buildings were probably erected within the last fifty
years.--The part inhabited by the monks is at this time
principally employed as a cotton-mill; and, were it in England,
nobody would suspect that it ever had any other destination. Of the
church, the tower<a name="FNanchor56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> only is in existence. I find no
account of its date; though authors have been unusually profuse in
their details of all particulars relating to this monastery. I am
inclined to refer it to the beginning of the seventeenth century,
in which case it was built shortly after the destruction of the
nave. Its character is simple, solid elegance. Its ornaments are
few, but they are selected and disposed with judgment. Each corner
is flanked by two buttresses, which unite at top, and there
terminate in a crocketed pinnacle. The buttresses are also
ornamented with tabernacles of saints at different heights; and one
of the tabernacles upon each buttress, about mid-way up the tower,
still retains a statue as large as life, of apparently good
workmanship. They were fortunately too high for the democrats to
destroy with ease. The height of the tower is one hundred and fifty
feet, as I found by the staircase of two hundred steps, <a name="Page_107"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;107]</span></a>which
remains uninjured, in a circular turret attached to the south side.
The termination of this turret is the most singular part of the
structure: it is surmounted by a cap, considerably higher than the
pinnacles, and composed, like a bee-hive, of a number of circles,
each smaller than the one below it. A few ruined arches of the east
end of the church, and of one of the side chapels are also
existing. The rest is levelled with the ground, and has probably
been in a great measure destroyed lately; for piles of wrought
stones are heaped up on all sides.</p>

<p>If historical recollections or architectural beauty could have
proved a protection in the days of revolution, the church of Bec
had undoubtedly stood. Ducarel, who saw it in its perfection, says
it was one of the finest gothic structures in France; and his
account of it, though only an abridgement of that given by Du
Plessis, in his <i>History of Upper Normandy</i>, is curious and
valuable.--Mr. Gough states the annual income of the abbey at
the period of the revolution, to have exceeded twenty thousand
crowns. Its patronage was most extensive: the monks presented to
one hundred and sixty advowsons, two of them in the metropolis; and
thirty other ecclesiastical benefices, as well priories as chapels,
were in their gift<a name="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>.--Its possessions, as we
may collect from the various charters and donations, might have led
us to expect a larger revenue. The estates belonging to the
monastery in England, prior to the reformation, were both numerous
and valuable.</p>

<p>Sammarthanus, author of the <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, says, in
speaking of Bec, that, whether considered as to religion or
literature, there was not, in the eleventh century, <a name="Page_108"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;108]</span></a>a more
celebrated convent throughout the whole of Neustria. The founder of
the abbey was Hellouin, sometimes called Herluin, a nobleman,
descended by the mother's side from the Counts of Flanders, but he
himself was a native of the territory of Brionne, and educated in
the castle of Gislebert, earl of that district. Hellouin
determined, at an early age, to withdraw himself from the court and
from the world: it seems he was displeased or affronted by the
conduct of the earl; and we may collect from the chroniclers, that
it was not a very easy task in those times for an individual of
rank, intent upon monastic seclusion, to carry his purpose into
effect, and that still greater difficulties were to be encountered
if he wished to put his property into mortmain. Hellouin was
obliged to counterfeit madness, and at last to come to a very
painful explanation with his liege lord; and, when he finally
succeeded in obtaining the permission he craved, his establishment
was so poor, that he was compelled to take upon himself the office
of abbot, from an inability to find any other person who would
accept it.--The monkish historians lavish their praises upon
Hellouin. They assign to him every virtue under heaven; but they
particularly laud him for his humility and industry: all day long
he worked as a laborer in the building of his convent, whilst the
night was passed in committing the psalter to memory. At this
period of his life, a curious anecdote is recorded of him: curious
in itself, as illustrative of the character of the man; and
particularly curious, in being quoted as matter of commendation,
and thus serving to illustrate the feelings of a great body of the
community.--His mother, who shared in the pious disposition of
her son, had attached herself to the convent <a name="Page_109"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;109]</span></a>to
assist in the menial offices; and one day, while she was thus
engaged, the building caught fire, and she perished in the flames;
upon which, Hellouin, though bathed in tears, lifted up his hands
to heaven, and gave thanks to God that his parent had been burned
to death in the midst of an occupation of humility and piety!</p>

<p>During the life of Hellouin, the abbey was twice levelled with
the ground: on each occasion it rose more splendid from its ruins,
and on each the site was changed, till at length it was fixed upon
the spot from which its ruins are now vanishing. The whole of
Normandy would scarcely furnish a more desirable situation. Under
the prelacy of Hellouin, Bec increased rapidly in celebrity, and
consequently in the number of its inmates: it was principally
indebted for this increase to an accidental circumstance. Lanfranc,
a native of Pavia, a lawyer in Italy, but a monk in France, after
having visited various monasteries, and distinguished himself by
defending the doctrine of the real presence, then impugned by
Berengarius, established himself here in the year 1042, and
immediately opened a school, which, to judge from the language of
Ordericus Vitalis<a name="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>, seems to have been the first
ever known in Normandy. Scholars from France, from England, and
from Flanders, hastened to place themselves under his care; his
fame, according to William of Malmesbury, went forth into the outer
parts of the earth; <a name="Page_110"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;110]</span></a>and Bec, under his auspices,
became a most celebrated resort of literature. To borrow the more
copious account given by William of Jumieges--"report quickly
spread the glory of Bec, and of its abbot, Hellouin, through every
land. The clergy, the sons of dukes, the most eminent
schoolmasters, the most powerful of the laity, and the nobility,
all hastened hither. Many, actuated by love for Lanfranc, gave
their lands to the convent. The abbey was enriched with ornaments,
with possessions, and with noble inmates. Religion and learning
increased; property of all kinds abounded; and the monks, who but a
few years before, could scarcely command sufficient ground for the
site of their own building, now saw their estates extend for many
miles in a lengthening line."--Promotion followed the fame of
Lanfranc, who soon became abbot of the royal monastery of St.
Stephen, at Caen, and thence was translated to the archiepiscopal
see of Canterbury.</p>

<p>It was the rare good fortune of Bec, that the abbey furnished
two successive metropolitans to the English church, both of them
selected for their erudition, Lanfranc and Anselm. It is not a
little remarkable, too, that both were Italians. Lanfranc, whilst
archbishop of Canterbury, presided in the year 1077, at the
dedication of the third church built at Bec. We may judge how far
the abbey had at that time increased in consequence; for five
bishops, one of them brother to the Conqueror, honored the ceremony
with their presence; and the nobles and ladies of France, Normandy,
and England crowded to the spot, to refresh their bodies by the
pleasures of the festival, and their souls by endowments to the
convent.</p>

<p><a name="Page_111"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;111]</span></a></p>
<p>In the fifteenth century, when our Henry Vth brought his
victorious armies into France, the monks of Bec were reduced to a
painful alternative. It was apprehended by the French monarch, that
the monastery might be converted into a d&eacute;p&ocirc;t by the
English; and they were commanded either to demolish the church, or
to fortify it against the invaders. They naturally regarded the
latter as the lesser evil; and the consequence was, that the abbey
was scarcely put into a state of defence, when it was attacked by
the enemy, and, after sustaining a siege for a month, was obliged
to surrender. A great part of the monastic buildings were levelled
to the ground; and the fortifications which had been so strangely
affixed to them were also razed: meanwhile the monks suffered
grievously from the contending parties: their sacristy was
plundered; their treasury emptied; and they were themselves exposed
to a variety of personal hardships. At the same time, also, the
tomb of the Empress Maud<a name="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>, which faced the high <a name="Page_112"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;112]</span></a>altar,
was destroyed, after having been stripped of its silver
ornaments.</p>

<p><a name="Page_113"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;113]</span></a></p>
<p>Considering the number of illustrious persons who were abbots or
patrons of Bec, and who had been elected from it to the
superintendance of other monasteries, the church does not appear to
have been rich in monuments. We read indeed of many individuals who
were interred here belonging to the house of Neubourg, a family
distinguished among the benefactors of the convent; and the records
of the abbey speak also of the tomb of Richard of St. Leger, Bishop
of Evreux; but the Empress was the only royal personage who
selected this convent as the resting-place for her remains; and she
likewise appears to have been the only eminent one, except
Hellouin, the founder, who lay in the chapter-house, under a slab
of black marble, with various figures of rude workmanship<a name="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> carved
upon it. His epitaph has more merit than the general class of
monumental inscriptions:--</p>

<p><a name="Page_114"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;114]</span></a></p>
<p>In number of inmates, extent of possessions, and possibly, in
magnificence of buildings, other Norman monasteries may have
excelled Bec: none equalled it in the prouder honor of being a
seminary for eminent men and especially for those destined to the
highest stations in the church. Lanfranc and Anselm were not the
only two of its monks who were seated on the archiepiscopal throne
at Canterbury. Two others, Theobald and Hubert obtained the same
dignity in the following century; and Roger, the seventh abbot of
Bec, enjoyed the still more enviable distinction of having been
unanimously elected to fill the office of metropolitan, but of
possessing sufficient firmness of mind to resist the attractions of
wealth, and rank, and power. The sees of Rochester, Beauvais, and
Evreux were likewise filled by monks from Bec; and it was here that
many monastic establishments, both Norman and foreign, found their
pastors. Three of our own most celebrated convents, those of
Chester, Ely, and St. Edmund's Bury, received at different epochs
their abbots from Bec; and during the prelacy of Anselm, the
supreme pontiff himself selected a monk of this house as the prior
of the distant convent of the holy Savior at Capua.--The
village of Bec, which adjoins the abbey, is small and
unimportant.</p>

<p>I was returning to our carriage, when a soldier invited me to
walk to a part of the monastic grounds (for they are very
extensive) which is appropriated to the purpose of keeping up the
true breed of Norman horses. The French government have several
similar establishments: they consider the matter as one of national
importance; and, as France has not yet produced a Duke of Bedford
<a name="Page_115"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;115]</span></a>or a Mr. Coke, the state is
obliged to undertake what would be much better effected by the
energy of individuals.--A Norman horse is an excellent draft
horse: he is strong, bony, and well proportioned. But the natives
are not content with this qualified praise: they contend that he is
equally unrivalled as a saddle-horse, as a hunter, and as a
charger. In this part of the country the present average price of a
hussar's horse is nineteen pounds; of a dragoon's thirty-four
pounds; and of an officer's eighty pounds.--These prices are
considered high, but not extravagant. France abounds at this time
in fine horses. The losses occasioned by the revolutionary wars,
and more especially by the disastrous Russian campaign, have been
more than compensated by five years of peace, and by the horses
that were left by the allied troops. An annual supply is also drawn
from Mecklenburg and the adjacent countries. Importations of this
kind are regarded as indispensable, to prevent a degeneration in
the stock. A Frenchman can scarcely be brought to believe it
possible; that we in England can preserve our fine breed of horses
without having recourse to similar expedients; and if at last, by
dint of repeated asseverations, you succeed in obtaining a
reluctant assent, the conversation is almost sure to end in a shrug
of the shoulders, accompanied with the remark--"Ah, vous
autres Anglais, vous voulez toujours voler de vos propres
ailes."</p>

<p>As we approached Brionne, the face of the country became more
uneven; and we passed an extensive tract of uncultivated chalk
hills, resembling the downs of Wiltshire.--Brionne itself lies
in a valley watered by the Risle: the <a name="Page_116"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;116]</span></a>situation is agreeable,
and advantageous for trade. The present number of its inhabitants
does not amount to two thousand; and there is no reason to
apprehend that the population has materially decreased of late
years. But in the times of Norman rule, Brionne was a town of more
importance: it had then three churches, besides an abbey and a
lazar-house. At present a single church only remains; and this is
neither large, nor handsome, nor ancient, nor remarkable in any
point of view. We found in it a monument of the revolution, which I
never saw elsewhere, and which I never expected to see at all. The
age of reason was a sadly irrational age.--The tablet
containing the rights and duties of man, disposed in two columns,
like the tables of the Mosaic law, is still suffered to exist in
the church, though shorn of all its republican dignity, and
degraded into the front of a pew.</p>

<p>On the summit of a hill that overhangs the town, stood formerly
the castle of the Earls of Brionne; and a portion of the building,
though it be but an insignificant fragment, is still left. The part
now standing consists of little more than two sides of the square
dungeon, The walls, which are about fifty feet in height, appear
crumbling and ragged, as they have lost the greater part of their
original facing. Yet their thickness, which even now exceeds twelve
feet, may enable them to bid defiance for many a century, to "the
heat of the sun, and the furious winter's rages."--Nearly the
half of one of the sides, which is seventy feet long, is occupied
by three flat Norman buttresses, of very small projection. No
arched door-way, no window remains; nor any thing, except <a name="Page_117"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;117]</span></a>these
buttresses, to give a distinct character to the architecture: the
hill is so overgrown with brush-wood, that though traces of
foundation are discernible in almost every part of it, no clear
idea can be formed of the dimensions or plan of the building. Its
importance is sufficiently established by its having been the
residence of a son or brother of Richard IInd, Duke of Normandy, on
whose account, the town of Brionne, with the adjacent territory,
was raised into an earldom. Historians speak unequivocally of its
strength. During the reign of William the Conqueror, it was
regarded as impregnable. This king was little accustomed to meet
with disappointment or even with resistance; but the castle of
Brionne defied his utmost efforts for three successive years. Under
his less energetic successor, it was taken in a day. Its possessor,
Robert, Earl of Brionne, felt himself so secure within his towers,
that he ventured, with only six attendants, to oppose the whole
army of the Norman Duke; but the besiegers observed that the
fortress was roofed with wood; and a shower of burning missiles
compelled the garrison to surrender at discretion.--The castle
was finally dismantled by the orders of Charles Vth.</p>

<p>Brionne is known in ecclesiastical history as the place where
the council of the church was held, by which the tenets of
Berengarius were finally condemned. It appears that the archdeacon
of Angers, after some fruitless attempts to make converts among the
Norman monks, took the bold resolution of stating his doctrines to
the duke in person; and that the prince, though scarcely arrived at
years of manhood, acted with so much prudence on the <a name="Page_118"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;118]</span></a>occasion, as to withhold any
decisive answer, till he had collected the clergy of the duchy.
They assembled at Brionne, as a central spot; and here the question
was argued at great length, till Berengarius himself, and a
convert, whom he had brought with him, trusting in his eloquence,
were so overpowered by the arguments of their adversaries, that
they were obliged to renounce their errors. The doctrine of the
real presence in the sacrament, was thus incontrovertibly
established; and it has from that time remained an undisputed
article of faith in the Roman Catholic church.</p>

question always existed, whether the Empress was really buried
here, or at the abbey of Ste Marie des Pr&eacute;s, at Rouen.
Hoveden expressly says, that she was interred at Rouen: the
chronicle of Bec, on the other hand, is equally positive in the
assertion that her body was brought to Bec, and entombed with honor
before the altar of the Virgin. The same chronicle adds that, in
the year 1273, her remains were discovered before the high altar,
sewed up in an ox's hide.--Still farther to substantiate their
claim, the monks of Bec maintained that, in 1684, upon the occasion
of some repairs being done to this altar, the bones of the empress
were again found immediately under the lamp (which, in Catholic
churches, is kept constantly burning before the holy sacrament,)
and that they were deposited once more in the ground in a wooden
chest, covered with lead.--The Empress was a munificent
endower of monasteries, and was at all times most liberal towards
Bec. William of Jumieges says, that it would be tedious to
enumerate the presents she made to the abbey, but that the sight of
them gave pleasure to those strangers who have seen the treasures
of the most noble churches. His remarks on this matter, and his
account of her arguments with her father, on the subject of her
choice of Bec, as a place of her interment, deserve to be
transcribed.--"Transiret illac hospes Gr&aelig;cus aut Arabs,

<h4>
BERNAT--BROGLIE--ORBEC--LISIEUX--CATHEDRAL--ECCLESIASTICAL
HISTORY.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Lisieux, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Instead of pursuing the straight road from Brionne to this city,
we deviated somewhat to the south, by the advice of M. Le Prevost;
and we have not regretted the deviation.</p>

<p>Bernay was once celebrated for its abbey, founded in the
beginning of the eleventh century, by Judith, wife of Richard IInd,
Duke of Normandy. Some of the monastic buildings are standing, and
are now inhabited: they appear to have been erected but a short
time before the revolution, and to have suffered little
injury.--But the abbey church, which belonged to the original
structure, is all desolate within, and all defaced without. The
interior is divided into two stories, the lower of which is used as
a corn market, the upper as a cloth hall. Thus blocked up and
encumbered, we may yet discern that it is a noble building: its
dimensions are grand, and in most parts it is a perfect specimen of
the semi-circular style, except the windows and the apsis, which
are of later dates. The pillars in the nave and choir are lofty,
but massy: the capitals of some of them are curiously sculptured.
On the lower member of the entablature of one capital there are
still traces of an inscription; but it is so injured by neglect and
violence, that <a name="Page_120"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;120]</span></a>we were unable to decipher a
single word. The capital itself is fanciful and not devoid of
elegance.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_13"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_13.png" height="277" width="308" alt="Capital" /></p>

<p>The convent was placed under the immediate protection of the
sovereign, by virtue of an ordinance issued by Philip Augustus<a
name="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>,
in 1280, at which time Peter, Count of Alen&ccedil;on, attempted to
establish a claim to some rights affecting the monastery. He
alleged a grant from a former monarch to one of his predecessors,
by whom he asserted that the convent had been founded; and, in
support of his claim, he urged its position within the limits of
his territory. The abbot and monks resisted: they gave proof that
the abbey of Bernay was really founded by the duchess; and
therefore the king, after a full and <a name="Page_121"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;121]</span></a>impartial hearing,
decided against the count, and declared that the advocation of the
monastery was thenceforth to belong to himself and his successors
in the dukedom for ever.--Judith died before the convent was
entirely built, and the task of completing it devolved upon her
widowed husband, whose charter, confirming the foundation, is still
in existence. It begins by a recital of the pious motives<a name="FNanchor62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> which
urged the duchess to the undertaking; it expressly mentions her
death while the building was yet unfinished; and, after detailing
the various lands and grants bestowed on the abbey, it concludes by
denouncing the anger of God, and a fine of two hundred pounds
weight of gold upon those who disturb the establishment, "that they
may learn to their confusion that the good deeds of their
ancestors, undertaken for the love of God, are not to be undone
with impunity."</p>

<p>The parochial church at Bernay is uninteresting. The sculptures,
however, which adorn the high altar, are relics saved from the
destruction of the abbey of Bec. The Virgin Mary and Joseph are
represented, contemplating the infant Jesus, who is asleep. The
statues are <a name="Page_122"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;122]</span></a>all of the natural size. We saw
many grave-stones from the same abbey, nine or ten feet long, and
covered with monumental figures of the usual description, indented
in the stone. These memorials were standing by the side of the
church door, not for preservation, but for sale! And at a small
chapel in the burial-ground near the town, we were shewn twelve
statues of saints, which likewise came from Bec. They are of
comparatively modern workmanship, larger than life, and carved in a
good, though not a fine, style. In the same chapel is kept the
common coffin for the interment of all the poor at Bernay.</p>

<p>The custom of merely putting the bodies of persons of the lower
class into coffins, when they are brought to the burial-ground, and
then depositing them naked in their graves, prevails at present in
this part of France as it did formerly in England.--In a place
which must be the receptacle for many that were in easy, and for
not a few that were in affluent, circumstances, it was remarkable
that all lay indiscriminately side by side, unmarked by any
monumental stone, or any sepulchral record.--Republican France
proscribed distinctions of every description, and those memorials
which tended to perpetuate distinctions beyond the limits of mortal
existence, were naturally most unpardonable in the eyes of the
apostles of equality. But doctrines of this nature have fallen into
disrepute for more than twenty years; and yet the country
church-yard remains as naked as when the guillotine would have been
the reward of opposition to the tenets of the day. There are few
more comfortless sights, than such a cemetery: it looks as if those
by whom it is occupied regarded death as eternal sleep, and thought
that the memory of man should terminate with the close of his life.
However <a name="Page_123"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;123]</span></a>unlettered the muse, however
hackneyed the rhyme, however misapplied the text, it is consolatory
to see them employed. Man dwells with a melancholy satisfaction
upon the tomb-stones of his relations and friends, and not of them
alone, but of all whom he has known or of whom he has
heard.--A mere <i>hic jacet</i>, with the name and years of
him that sleeps beneath, frequently recals the most lively
impressions; and he who would destroy epitaphs would destroy a
great incitement to virtue.--In other parts of France
tomb-stones, or crosses charged with monumental inscriptions, have
re-appeared: at Bernay we saw only two; one of them commemorated a
priest of the town; the other was erected at the public expence, to
the memory of three gendarmes, who were killed at the beginning of
the revolution, and before religion was proscribed, in the
suppression of some tumult.</p>

<p>At less than a mile from Bernay, in the opposite direction, is
another church, called Notre Dame de la Couture, a name borrowed
from the property on which it stands. We were induced to visit it,
by the representation of different persons in the town, who had
noticed our architectural propensities. Some assured us that "C'est
une belle pi&egrave;ce;" others that "C'est une pi&egrave;ce qui
n'est pas vilaine;" and all concurred in praising it, though some
only for the reason that "les processions vont tout autour du
choeur."--We found nothing to repay the trouble of the
walk.</p>

<p>Bernay contains upwards of six thousand inhabitants, the greater
part of whom are engaged in manufacturing coarse woollen and cotton
cloths; and the manufactures flourish, the goods made being
principally for home consumption. It is the chief place of the
<i>arrondissement</i>, and <a name="Page_124"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;124]</span></a>the residence of a
sub-prefect.--Most of the houses are like those at Rouen,
merely wooden frames filled with mortar, which, in several
instances, is faced with small bricks and flints, disposed in
fanciful patterns: here and there the beams are carved with a
variety of grotesque figures. The lower story of all those in the
high street retires, leaving room for a wooden colonnade, which
shelters the passenger, though it is entirely destitute of all
architectural beauty. The head-dress of the females at Bernay is
peculiar, and so very archaic, that our chamber-maid at the inn
appeared to deserve a sketch, full as much as any monumental
effigy.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_14"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_14.png" height="299" width="210" alt="Head-dress of females of Bernay" /></p>

<p>On our road between Bernay and Orbec, we stopped at the village
of Chambrais, more commonly called Broglie. <a name="Page_125"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;125]</span></a>Before
the revolution, it belonged to the noble family of that name, and
it thence derived its familiar appellation. The former residence of
the Seigneurs of Broglie, which is still standing, apparently
uninjured, upon an adjoining eminence, has lately been restored to
the present Mar&eacute;chal Duc de Broglie. It looks like an
extensive parish work-house, or like any thing rather than a
nobleman's seat.--The village church is very ancient and still
curious, though in parts considerably modernized. Unlike most
churches of great antiquity, it is not built in the form of a
cross, but consists only of a nave and choir, with side-aisles and
an apsis, all on a small scale<a name="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>. Towards the north, the nave is
separated from the aisle by some of the largest and rudest piers I
ever saw. They occupy full two-thirds of the width of the
intervening arches, which are five feet wide, elliptic rather than
semi-circular, and altogether without ornament of any kind. Above
each of these arches is a narrow, circular-headed window, banded
with a cylindrical pilaster; and, in most instances, a row of
quatrefoils runs between the pillar and the window. The bases of
the windows rest upon a string-course that extends round the whole
building; and on this also, alternating with the windows, rest
corbels, from which spring very short, clustered columns, intended
to support the groinings of the roof. On the <a name="Page_126"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;126]</span></a>south
side, the massy piers have been pared into comparatively slender
pillars; and the arches are pointed, as are all the lower windows
in the church.--The font is of stone, and ancient: it consists
of a round basin, on a quadrangular pedestal, like many in
England.--The west front of the church is peculiar. It is
entered by a very wide, low, semi-circular door-way, of rude
architecture, and quite unornamented. Above is a window
corresponding with those in the clerestory; and, still higher, a
row of interlaced arches, also semi-circular. A pointed arch, the
receptacle for the statue of a saint, surmounts the whole; but this
is, most probably, of a later &aelig;ra, as evidently are the two
lateral compartments, which terminate in slender spires of slate,
and are separated from the central division by Norman
buttresses.</p>

<p>We stopped to dine at Orbec, a small and insignificant country
town, formerly an appendage of the houses of Orl&eacute;ans and
Navarre, with the title of a barony; but, more immediately before
the revolution, the domain of the family of Chaumont. Its church is
a most uncouth edifice: the plan is unusual; the entrance is in the
north transept, which ends in a square high tower.</p>

<p>Bernay, Orbec, and Lisieux, communicate only by cross roads,
scarcely passable by a carriage, even at this season of the year.
From Orbec to Lisieux the road runs by the side of the Touques,
which, at Orbec, is no more than a rivulet. The beautiful green
meadows in the valley, appear to repay the great care which is
taken in the draining and irrigating of them. They are every where
intersected by small trenches, in which the water is confined by
means of sluices.--In this part of the <a name="Page_127"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;127]</span></a>country,
we passed several flocks of sheep, the true <i>moutons du pays</i>,
a large breed, with red legs and red spotted faces. Their coarse
wool serves to make the ordinary cloth of the country, but is
inapplicable to any of a finer texture. To remedy this deficiency,
and, if possible, improve the local manufactures, some large flocks
of Merino sheep were imported at the time when the French occupied
Spain; and they are said to thrive. But it is only of late years
that any attempts, have been made of the kind.--The Norman
farmer, however careful about the breed of his horses, has
altogether neglected his sheep; and this is the more extraordinary,
considering that the prosperity of the province is inseparably
connected with that of the manufactures, and that much of the value
of the produce must of necessity depend upon the excellence of the
material. His pigs are the very perfection of ugliness: it is no
hyperbole to say, that, in their form, they partake as much of a
greyhound as of an English pig.--These animals are sure to
attract the gaze of our countrymen; and poor Trotter, in his
narrative of the journey of Mr. Fox, expressed his marvel so often,
as to call down upon himself the witty vengeance of one of our
ablest periodical writers.</p>

<p>Melons are cultivated on a great scale in the country about
Lisieux. They grow here in the natural soil, occupying whole fields
of considerable size, and apparently without requiring any
extraordinary pains.--As we approached the city, the meadows,
through which we passed, were mostly occupied as extensive
bleaching-grounds. Lisieux is an industrious manufacturing town.
Its ten thousand inhabitants find their chief employment in the <a
name="Page_128"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;128]</span></a>making of the ordinary woollen
cloths, worn by the peasantry of Normandy and of Lower Brittany.
Linen and flannels are also manufactured here, though on a
comparatively trifling scale. For trade of this description,
Lisieux is well situated upon the banks of the Touques, a small
river, which, almost immediately under the walls of the town,
receives the waters of a yet smaller stream, the Orbec. A project
is in agitation, and it is said that it may be carried into effect
at an inconsiderable expence, of making the Touques navigable to
Lisieux. At present, it is so no farther than the the little town
of the same name as the river; and even this derives no great
advantage from the navigation; for, however near its situation is
to the mouth of the stream, it is approachable only by vessels of
less than one hundred tons burthen.--It was at Touques that
Henry Vth landed in France, in the spring of 1417, when the
monarch, flushed with a degree of success as extraordinary as it
was unexpected, quitted England with the determination of returning
no more till the whole kingdom of France should be subjugated.</p>

<p>The greater part of the houses in Lisieux are built of wood; and
many of them are old, and most of them are mean; yet, on the whole,
it is picturesque and handsome. Its streets are spacious, and
contain several large buildings: it is surrounded with pleasant
<i>boulevards</i>; and its situation, like that of most other
Norman towns, is delightful.--In consequence of the
revolution, the city has lost the privilege of being an episcopal
see. Even when Napol&eacute;on, by virtue of the concordat of 1801,
restored the Gallican church to its obedience to the the <a name="Page_129"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;129]</span></a>supreme
Pontiff, the see of Lisieux was suppressed. The six suffragan
bishops of ancient Normandy were at that time reduced to four,
conformably to the number of the departments of the province; and
Lisieux and Avranches merged in the more important dioceses of
Bayeux and Coutances.</p>

<p>The cathedral, now the parish church of St. Peter, derived,
however, one advantage from the revolution. Another church,
dedicated to St. Germain, which had previously stood immediately
before it, so as almost to block up the approach, was taken down,
and the west front of the cathedral was made to open upon a
spacious square.--Solid, simple grandeur are the characters of
this front, which, notwithstanding some slight anomalies, is, upon
the whole, a noble specimen of early pointed architecture.--It
is divided into three equal compartments, the lateral ones rising
into short square towers of similar height. The southern tower is
surmounted by a lofty stone spire, probably of a date posterior to
the part below. The spire of the opposite tower fell in 1553, at
which time much injury was done to the building, and particularly
to the central door-way, which, even to the present day, has never
been repaired.--Contrary to the usual elevation of French
cathedrals, the great window over the principal entrance is not
circular, but pointed: it is divided into three compartments by
broad mullions, enriched with many mouldings. The compartments end
in acute pointed arches.--In the north tower, the whole of the
space from the basement story is occupied by only two tiers of
windows. Each tier contains <a name="Page_130"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;130]</span></a>two windows, extremely narrow,
considering their height; and yet, narrow as they are, each of them
is parted by a circular mullion or central pillar. You will better
understand how high they must be, when told that, in the southern
tower, the space of the upper row is divided into three distinct
tiers; and still the windows do not appear disproportionately
short. They also are double, and the interior arches are pointed;
but the arches, within which they are placed, are circular. In this
circumstance lies the principal anomaly in the front of the
cathedral; but there is no appearance of any disparity in point of
dates; for the circular arches are supported on the same slender
mullions, with rude foliaged capitals, of great projection, which
are the most distinguishing characteristics of this style of
architecture.</p>

<p>The date of the building establishes the fact of the pointed
arch being in use, not only as an occasional variation, but in the
entire construction of churches upon a grand scale, as early as the
eleventh century.--Sammarthanus tells us that Bishop Herbert,
who died in 1049, began to build this church, but did not live to
see it completed; and Ordericus Vitalis expressly adds, that Hugh,
the successor to Herbert, upon his death-bed, in 1077, while
retracing his past life, made use of these words:--"Ecclesiam
Sancti Petri, principis apostolorum, quam venerabilis Herbertus,
praedecessor meus, coepit, perfeci, studios&egrave; adornavi,
honorific&egrave; dedicavi, et cultoribus necessariisque divino
servitio vasis aliisque apparatibus copios&egrave;
ditavi."--Language of this kind appears too explicit to leave
room for ambiguity, but an opinion has still prevailed, <a name="Page_131"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;131]</span></a>founded
probably upon the style of the architecture, that the cathedral was
not finished till near the expiration of the thirteenth century.
Admitting, however, such to be the fact, I do not see how it will
materially help those who favor the opinion; for the building is
far from being, as commonly happens in great churches, a medley of
incongruous parts; but it is upon one fixed plan; and, as it was
begun, so it was ended.--The exterior of the extremity of the
south transept is a still more complete example of the early
pointed style than the west front: this style, which was the most
chaste, and, if I may be allowed to use the expression, the most
severe of all, scarcely any where displays itself to greater
advantage. The central window is composed of five lancet divisions,
supported upon slender pillars: massy buttresses of several splays
bound it on either side.</p>

<p>The same character of uniformity extends over the interior of
the building. On each side of the nave is a side-aisle; and, beyond
the aisles, chapels. The pillars of the nave are cylindrical,
solid, and plain. Their bases end with foliage at each corner, and
foliage is also sculptured upon the capitals. The arches which they
support are acute.--The triforium is similar in plan to the
part below; but the capitals of the columns are considerably more
enriched, with an obvious imitation of the antique model, and every
arch encircles two smaller ones. In the clerestory the windows are
modern.--The transepts appear the oldest parts of the
cathedral, as is not unfrequently the case; whether they were
really built before the rest, or that, from being less used in the
services <a name="Page_132"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;132]</span></a>of the church, they were less
commonly the objects of subsequent alterations. They are large; and
each of them has an aisle on the eastern side. The architecture of
the choir resembles that of the nave, except that the five pillars,
which form the apsis, are slender and the intervening arches more
narrow and more acute.--The Lady-Chapel, which is long and
narrow, was built towards the middle of the fifteenth century, by
Peter Cauchon, thirty-sixth bishop of Lisieux, who, for his steady
attachment to the Anglo-Norman cause, was translated to this see,
in 1429, when Beauvais, of which he had previously been bishop,
fell into the hands of the French. He was selected, in 1431, for
the invidious office of presiding at the trial of the Maid of
Orl&eacute;ans. Repentance followed; and, as an atonement for his
unrighteous conduct, according to Ducarel, he erected this chapel,
and therein founded a high mass to the Holy Virgin, which was duly
sung by the choristers, in order, as is expressed in his
endowment-charter, to expiate the false judgment which he
pronounced<a name="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>.--The two windows by the
side of the altar in this chapel have been painted of a crimson
color, to add to the effect produced upon entering the church; and,
seen as they are, through the long perspective of the nave and the
distant arches of the choir, the glowing tint is by no means
unpleasing.--The central tower is open within the church to a
considerable height: it is supported by four arches of unusual
boldness, above which runs a row of small arches, of the same
character as the rest of the <a name="Page_133"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;133]</span></a>building; and, still higher, on
each side, are two lancet-windows.--The vaulting of the roof
is very plain, with bosses slightly pendant and carved.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_36"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_36.png" height="512" width="356" alt="Ancient Tomb in the Cathedral at Lisieux" /></p>

<p>At the extremity of the north transept is an ancient stone
sarcophagus, so built into the wall, that it appears to have been
incorporated with the edifice, at the period when it was raised.
The style of the medallions which adorn it will be best understood
by consulting the annexed sketch, which is very faithful, though
taken under every possible disadvantage. The transept is now used
as a school; and the little filthy imps, who are there taught to
drawl out their catechisms, continued swarming round the feverish
artist, during the progress of the drawing. The character of the
heads, the crowns, and the disposition of the foliage, may be
considered as indicating that it is a production, at least of the
Carlovingian period, if it be not indeed of earlier date. I believe
it is traditionally supposed to have been the tomb of a saint,
perhaps St. Candidus; but I am not quite certain whether I am
accurate in the recollection of the name.--Above are two armed
statues, probably of the twelfth or thirteenth centuries. These
have been engraved by Willemin, in his useful work, <i>Les Monumens
Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, under the title of <i>Two Armed Warriors, in
the Nave of the Cathedral at Lisieux</i>; and both are there
figured as if in all respects perfect, and with a great many
details which do not exist, and never could have existed, though at
the same time the draftsman has omitted the animals at the feet of
the statues, one of which is yet nearly entire.--This may be
reckoned among the innumerable proofs of the disregard of accuracy
which pervades the works of <a name="Page_134"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;134]</span></a>French antiquaries. A French
designer never scruples to sacrifice accuracy to what he considers
effect.--Willemin describes the monuments as being in the nave
of the church. I suspect that he has availed himself of the
unpublished collection of Gaignat, in this and many other
instances. It is evident that originally the statues were
recumbent; but I cannot ascertain when they changed their
position.--No other tombs now exist in the cathedral: the
brazen monument raised to Hannuier, an Englishman, the marble that
commemorated the bishop, William d'Estouteville, founder of the
<i>Coll&egrave;ge de Lisieux</i> at Paris, that of Peter Cauchon in
the Lady-Chapel, and all the rest, were destroyed during the
revolution.</p>

<p>The diocese of Lisieux was a more modern establishment than any
other in Normandy. Even those who are most desirous to honor it by
antiquity, do not venture to date its foundation higher than the
middle of the sixth century. Ordericus Vitalis, a monk of the
province, suggests with some reason that we ought not to be hasty
in forming our judgment upon these subjects; for that, owing to the
destruction caused by the Norman pirates and the abominable
negligence (<i>damnabilis negligentia</i>) of those to whom the
care of the records of religious houses had subsequently been
intrusted, many documents had been irretrievably lost.--The
see of Lisieux was also peculiarly unfortunate, in having twice
been in a state of anarchy, and on each occasion for a period of
more than a century. The series of its prelates is interrupted from
the year 670 to 853, and again from 876 to 990.</p>

<p>It is rather extraordinary, that no one of the Lexovian bishops
was ever admitted by the church into the catalogue <a name="Page_135"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;135]</span></a>of her
saints. Many of them were prelates of unquestionable merit.
Freculfus, in the ninth century, was a patron of literature, and
himself an author; Hugh of Eu, grandson of Richard, Duke of
Normandy, was one of the most illustrious ecclesiastics of his day;
Gilbert is described by Ordericus Vitalis as having been a man of
exemplary charity, and deeply versed in all sciences, though it is
admitted that he was somewhat too much addicted to worldly
pleasures, and not averse from gambling; and Arnulf, whose letters
and epigrams are preserved among the manuscripts of the Vatican,
was a prelate who would have done honor to St. Peter's
chair.--All these were bishops of Lisieux, during the ages
when canonization was not altogether so unfrequent as in our days.
Arnulf particularly distinguished himself by taking a leading part
in the principal transactions of the times. He accompanied the
crusaders to the holy land in 1147; five years subsequently he
officiated at the marriage of Henry Plantagenet with Eleanor of
Guyenne, the repudiated wife of Louis le Jeune, which was performed
in his cathedral; he assisted at the coronation of the same king,
by whom he was shortly afterwards employed in a mission of great
importance at Rome; and he interposed to settle the differences
between that sovereign and Thomas &agrave; Becket; and though he
espoused the part of the prelate, he had the good fortune to retain
the favor of the monarch. A life thus eventful ended with the
conviction that all was vanity!--Arnulf, disgusted with sublunary
honors, abdicated his see and retired to a monastery at Paris,
where he died.--<a name="Page_136"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;136]</span></a>One of the immediate successors
of this prelate, William of Rupierre, was the ambassador of Richard
Coeur-de-Lion to the Pope; and he pleaded the cause of his
sovereign against Walter, Archbishop of Rouen, on the occasion of
the differences that originated from the building of Château
Gaillard. He also resisted the power usurped by King John within
the city and liberties of Lisieux, and finally obtained a sentence
from the Norman court of exchequer, whereby the privileges of the
dukes of the province were restricted to what was called the
<i>Placitum Spath&aelig;</i>, consisting of the right of billetting
soldiers, of coining money, and of hearing and determining in cases
of appeal. The decision is honorable both to the independence of
the court, and the vigor of the prelate.--In times nearer to
our own, a bishop of Lisieux, Jean Hennuyer, obtained a very
different distinction. Authors are strangely at variance whether
this prelate is to be regarded as the protector or the persecutor
of the protestants. All agree that his church suffered materially
from the excesses of the Huguenots, in 1562, and that, on the
following year, he received public thanks from the Cardinal of
Bourbon, for the firmness with which he had opposed them; but the
point at issue is, whether, after the massacre of St. Bartholomew,
ten years subsequently, he withstood the sanguinary orders from the
court to put the Huguenots to the sword, or whether he endeavored,
as far as lay in his power, to forward the pious labor of
extirpating the heretics, but was himself effectually resisted by
the king's own lieutenant.--Sammarthanus tells us that the
first of these <a name="Page_137"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;137]</span></a>traditions rests solely upon
the authority of Anthony Mallet<a name="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> but it obtained general credence
till within the last three years, when a very well-informed writer,
in the <i>Mercure de France</i>, and subsequently in the article
<i>Hennuyer</i> in the <i>Bibliographie Universelle</i>, espoused,
and has apparently established, the opposite opinion.</p>

<p>We visited only one other of the churches in Lisieux, that of
St. Jacques, a large edifice, in a bad style of pointed
architecture, and full of gaudy altars and ordinary pictures. On
the outside of the stalls of the choir towards the north is some
curious carving; but I should scarcely have been induced to have
spoken of the building, were it not for one of the paintings,
which, however uninteresting as a piece of art, appears to possess
some historical value. It represents how the bones of St. Ursinus
were miraculously translated to Lisieux, under <a name="Page_138"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;138]</span></a>the
auspices of Hugh the Bishop, in 1055; and it professes, and
apparently with truth, to be a copy, made in the seventeenth
century, from an original of great antiquity. The legend relating
to the relics of this saint, is noticed by no author with whom I am
acquainted, nor do I find him mentioned any where in conjunction
with the church of Lisieux, or with any other Norman
diocese.--But the extraordinary privilege granted to the
canons of the cathedral, of being Earls of Lisieux, and of
exercising all civil and criminal jurisdiction within the earldom,
upon the vigil and feast-day of St. Ursinus, in every year, is most
probably connected with the tradition commemorated by the picture.
The actual existence of the privilege, in modern times, we learn
from Ducarel; who also details at length the curious ceremonies
with which the claim of it was accompanied. The exercise of these
rights was confirmed by a compact between the canons and the
bishop, who, prior to the revolution, united the secular coronet of
an earl with the episcopal mitre, and bore supreme sway in all
civil and ecclesiastical polity, during the remaining three hundred
and sixty-three days in the year.</p>

<h4>SITE AND RUINS OF THE CAPITAL OF THE LEXOVII--HISTORY OF
LISIEUX--MONASTERIES OF THE DIOCESE--ORDERICUS
VITALIS--M. DUBOIS--LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS
BORGHESE.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Lisieux, July</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Lisieux represents one of the most ancient capitals of the
primitive tribes of Gaul. The Lexovii, noticed by Julius
C&aelig;sar, in his <i>Commentaries</i>, and by other authors, who
were almost contemporary with the Roman conqueror, are supposed by
modern geographers to have occupied a territory nearly co-extensive
with the bishopric of Lisieux; and it may be remarked, that the
bounds of the ancient bishoprics of France were usually conterminal
with the Roman provinces and prefectures.</p>

<p>The capital of the Lexovii was called the <i>Neomagus</i> or
<i>Noviomagus Lexoviorum</i>; and no doubt ever was entertained but
that the present city occupied the same site, till an accidental
discovery, in the year 1770, proved the contrary to be the
fact.--About that time a <i>chauss&eacute;e</i> was formed
between Lisieux and Caen; and, in the course of some excavations,
which were made under the direction of M. Hubert, the
superintending engineer, for the purpose of procuring stone, the
laborers opened the foundations of some ruined buildings scattered
over a field, called <i>les Tourettes</i>, about three-quarters of
a mile from the former town. The character of these foundations was
of a nature to excite curiosity: they were <a name="Page_140"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;140]</span></a>clearly the work of a
remote age, and various specimens of ancient art were dug up
amongst the ruins. The extent of the foundations, which spread over
a space four times as large as the plot occupied by modern Lisieux
left no doubt but that Danville, and all other geographers, must
have been mistaken with respect to the position assigned by them to
the ancient Neomagus. M. Hubert drew a plan of the ruins, and
accompanied it with an historical memoir; but unfortunately he was
a man little capable of prosecuting such researches; and though M.
Mongez, in his report to the National Institute<a name="FNanchor66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>,
eulogized the map as exact, and the memoir as excellent, they were
both of them extremely faulty. It was reserved for M. Louis Dubois,
of whom I shall have occasion to speak again before I close this
letter, to repair the omissions and rectify the mistakes of M.
Hubert, and he has done it with unremitting zeal and extraordinary
success. The researches of this gentleman, among the remains of
Neomagus Lexoviorum, have already brought to light a large number
of valuable medals, both in silver and bronze, as well as a
considerable quantity of fragments of foreign marble, granite, and
porphyry, some of them curiously wrought. The most important of his
discoveries has been recently made: it is that of a Roman
amphitheatre, in a state of great perfection, the grades being
covered only by a thin layer of soil, which a trifling expence of
time and labor will effectually remove.</p>

<p>Such vestiges prove that Neomagus must have been a place of
importance; and, like the other Gallo-Roman <a name="Page_141"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;141]</span></a>cities,
it would probably have maintained its honors under the Franks; but
about the middle of the fourth century, the Saxons, swarming from
the mouths of the Elbe and Weser, laid waste the coasts of Belgium
and of Neustria, and finally established themselves in that portion
of northern Gaul called the <i>Secunda Lugdunensis</i>, which
thence obtained, in the <i>Notitia Imperii</i>, the title of the
<i>Littus Saxonicum</i>.--In the course of these incursions,
it is supposed that Neomagus was utterly destroyed by the invaders.
None of the medals dug up within the precincts of the town, or in
its neighborhood, bear a later date than the reign of Constantine;
and, though the city is recorded in the <i>Itinerary of
Antoninus</i>, no mention of it is to be found in the curious
chart, known by the name of the <i>Tabula Peutingeriana</i>, formed
under the reign of Theodosius the Great; so that it then appears to
have been completely swept away and forgotten.</p>

<p>The new town of Lisieux and the bishopric most probably arose
together, towards the close of the sixth century; and the city,
like other provincial capitals in Gaul, took the name of the tribe
by whom the district had been peopled. It first appears in history
under the appellation of <i>Lexovium</i> or <i>Lexobium</i>: in the
eleventh century, when Ordericus Vitalis composed his history, it
was called <i>Luxovium</i>; and soon after it became
<i>Lixovium</i>, and <i>Lizovium</i>, which, gallicised, naturally
passed into <i>Lyzieulx</i>, or, as it is now written,
<i>Lisieux</i>. The city was ravaged by the Normans about the year
877, in the course of one of their predatory excursions from
Bayeux: it again felt <a name="Page_142"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;142]</span></a>their vengeance early in the
following century, when Rollo, after taking Bayeux by storm, sacked
Lisieux at the head of his army on his way to Rouen. The conqueror
was not put in possession of the Lexovian territory by Charles the
Simple till 923, eleven years after the rest of Neustria had been
ceded to him.</p>

<p>United to the duchy, Lisieux enjoyed a short respite from the
calamities of war; nor does it appear to have borne any prominent
part in the transactions of the times. The name, indeed, of the
city occurs as the seat of the council held for the purpose of
degrading Malgerius from the primacy of Normandy; but, except on
this occasion, Lisieux is scarcely mentioned till the first year of
the twelfth century, when it was the seat of rebellion. Ralph
Flambart, bishop of Durham, a prelate of unbounded arrogance, had
fled from England, and joined Duke Robert, then in arms against his
brother. Raising the standard of insurrection, he fixed himself at
Lisieux, took forcible possession of the town, and invested his
son, only twelve years old, with the mitre<a name="FNanchor67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>, while
he himself exercised despotic authority over the inhabitants. At
length, he purchased peace and forgiveness, by opening <a name="Page_143"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;143]</span></a>the
gates to his lawful sovereign, after the battle of
Tinchbray.--In the middle of October, in the same year, Henry
returned to Lisieux, and there held an assembly of the Norman
nobility and prelates, who proclaimed peace throughout the duchy,
enacted sundry strict regulations to prevent any infringement of
the laws, and decreed that Robert, the captive duke, should be
consigned to an English prison.--Two years subsequently,
another council was also assembled at Lisieux, by the same
sovereign, and for nearly the same objects; and again, in 1119,
Henry convened his nobles a third time at Lisieux, when this
parliament ratified the peace concluded at Gisors, six years
previously, and witnessed the marriage<a name="FNanchor68"></a><a
href="#Footnote_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> of the king's son, William
Adelin, with Matilda, daughter of Fulk, earl of Anjou.</p>

<p>Historical distinction is seldom enviable:--in the wars
occasioned by the usurpation of Stephen, Lisieux once more obtained
an unfortunate celebrity. The town was attacked in 1136, by the
forces of Anjou, under the command of Geoffrey Plantagenet, husband
of the Empress <a name="Page_144"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;144]</span></a>Maud, joined by those of
William, Duke of Poitiers; and the garrison, consisting of Bretons,
seeing no hope of effectual resistance or of rescue, set fire to
the place to the extreme mortification of the invaders, who, in the
language of the chronicles of the times, "when they beheld the city
and all its wealth a prey to the flames, waxed exceedingly wroth,
at being deprived of the spoil; and grieved sorely for the loss of
the booty which perished in the conflagration."--The town,
however, was not so effectually ruined, but that, during the
following year, it served King Stephen as a rallying point, at
which to collect his army to march against his antagonist.--In
1169, it was distinguished by being selected by Thomas &agrave;
Becket, as the place of his retirement during his temporary
disgrace.</p>

<p>History from this time forward relates but little concerning
Lisieux. Though surrounded with walls during the bishopric of John,
who was promoted to the see early in the twelfth century, the
situation of the town, far from the coast or from the frontiers of
the province, rendered the inhabitants naturally unwarlike, and
caused them in general to submit quietly to the stronger
party.--Brito, in his <i>Philippiad</i>, says that, when
Philip Augustus took Lisieux, in 1213, the Lexovians, destitute of
fountains, disputed with the toads for the water of the muddy
ditches. His mentioning such a fact is curious, as shewing that
public fountains were at that early period of frequent occurrence
in Normandy.--Our countrymen, in the fifteenth century, acted
with great rigor, to use the mildest terms, towards Lisieux. Henry,
after landing at <a name="Page_145"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;145]</span></a>Touques, in 1417, entered the
town, in the character of an enraged enemy, not as the sovereign of
his people: he gave it up to plunder; and even the public archives
were not spared. The cruelty of our English king is strongly
contrasted by the conduct of the Count de Danois, general of the
army of Charles VIIth, to whom the town capitulated in 1449. Thomas
Basin, then bishop, negociated with such ability, that, according
to Monstrelet, "not the slightest damage was done to any
individual, but each peaceably enjoyed his property as before the
surrender."</p>

<p>The most celebrated monasteries within the diocese of Lisieux
were the Benedictine abbeys of Bernay, St. Evroul, Preaux, and
Cormeilles.--Cormeilles was founded by William Fitz-Osborne, a
relation to William the Conqueror, at whose court he held the
office of sewer, and by whom he was promoted to the earldom of
Hereford. Its church and monastic buildings had so far gone to
ruin, in the last century, as to call forth a strong remonstrance
from Mabillon<a name="FNanchor69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>: they were afterwards repaired
by Charles of Orl&eacute;ans, who was appointed abbot in
1726.--The abbey of Preaux is said to have existed prior to
the invasion of the Normans; but its earliest records go no farther
back than the middle of the eleventh century, when it was restored
by Humphrey de Vetulis, who built and inclosed the monastery about
the year 1035, at which time Duke Robert undertook his pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. This abbey, according to the account given by
Gough, in his <i>Alien Priories</i>, <a name="Page_146"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;146]</span></a>presented to thirty
benefices, and enjoyed an annual revenue of twenty thousand
livres.--Among its English lands which were considerable, was
the priory of Toft-Monks in our own immediate vicinity: the name,
as you know, remains, though no traces of the building are now in
existence.</p>

<p>The third abbey, that of St. Evrau or St. Evroul, called in
Latin, <i>Monasterium Uticense</i>, was one of the most renowned
throughout Normandy. The abbey dates its origin from St. Evroul
himself, a nobleman, who lived in the reign of Childebert, and was
attached to the palace of that monarch, "from which," to use the
words of the chronicles, "he made his escape, as from shipwreck,
and fled to the woods, and entered upon the monastic
life."--The legend of St. Ebrulfus probably savors of romance,
the almost inseparable companion of traditional, and particularly
of monastic, history: it is safer, therefore, to be contented with
referring the foundation of the monastery to the tenth century,
when William Gerouis, after having been treacherously deprived of
his sight and otherwise maimed, renounced the world; and, uniting
with his nephews, Hugh and Robert de Grentemaisnil, brought
considerable possessions to the endowment of this abbey. The abbey
was at all times protected by the especial favor of the kings of
France. No payment or service could be demanded from its monks;
they acknowledged no master without their own walls, besides the
sovereign himself; they were entitled to exemption from every kind
of burthen; and they had the privilege of being empowered to
castellate the convent, and to compel the people of the <a name="Page_147"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;147]</span></a>surrounding district to
contribute their assistance for the purpose.</p>

<p>St. Evroul, however, principally claims our attention, as the
sanctuary where Ordericus Vitalis, to use his own expressions,
"delighted in obedience and poverty."--This most valuable
writer was an Englishman; his native town being Attingesham, on the
Severn, where he was born in the year 1075. He was sent to school
at Shrewsbury, and there received the first rudiments, both of the
<i>humanities</i> and of ecclesiastical education. In the tenth
year of his age, his father, Odelerius, delivered the boy to the
care of the monk Rainaldus. The weeping father parted from the
weeping son, and they never saw each other more. Ordericus crossed
the sea, and arrived in Normandy, an exile, as he describes
himself, and "hearing, like Joseph in Egypt, a language which he
understood not." In the eleventh year of his age, he received the
tonsure from the hands of Mainerius, the abbot of St. Evroul. In
the thirty-third year of his age, he was ordained a priest; and
thenceforward his life wore away in study and tranquillity. Aged
and infirm, he completed his <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, in the
sixty-seventh year of his age; and this great and valuable work
ends with his auto-biography, which is written in an affecting
strain of simplicity and piety.--The Ecclesiastical History of
Ordericus is divided into parts: the first portion contains an
epitome of the sacred and profane history of the world, beginning
with the incarnation, and ending with Pope Innocent IInd. The
second, and more important division, contains the history of
Normandy, from the first invasion of the country, <a name="Page_148"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;148]</span></a>down to
the year 1141.--Though professedly an ecclesiastical
historian, yet Ordericus Vitalis is exceedingly copious in his
details of secular events; and it is from these that his chronicle
derives its importance and curiosity. It was first published by
Duchesne, in his collection of Norman historians, a work which is
now of rare occurrence, and it has never been reprinted.</p>

<p>Valuable materials for a new edition were, however, collected
early in the eighteenth century, by William Bessin, a monk of St.
Ouen; and these, before the revolution, were preserved in the
library of that abbey. Bessin had been assisted in the task by
Francis Charles Dujardin, prior of St. Evroul, who had collated the
text, as published in the collection of Norman historians, with the
original manuscript in his own monastery, to which latter Duchesne
unfortunately had not access, but had been obliged to content
himself with a copy, now in the Royal Library at Paris. It is to be
hoped, that the joint labors of Bessin and Dujardin may still be in
existence, and may come to light, when M. Liquet shall have
completed the task of arranging the manuscripts in the public
library at Rouen. The manuscript which belonged to St. Evroul, and
was always supposed to be an autograph from the hands of Ordericus
Vitalis himself, was discovered during the revolution among a heap
of parchments, thrown aside as of no account, in some buildings
belonging to the former district of Laigle. It is now deposited in
the public library of the department of the Orne, but
unfortunately, nearly half the leaves of the volume are lost. The
earliest part of what remains is towards <a name="Page_149"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;149]</span></a>the close of the seventh
book, and of this only a fragment, consisting of eight pages, is
left. The termination of the seventh book, and the whole of the
eighth are wanting. From the ninth to the thirteenth, both of these
inclusive, the manuscript is perfect. A page or two, however, at
the end of the work, which contained the author's life, has been
torn out.--At the beginning of the sixteenth century, the
manuscript was complete; for it is known that, at that time, a monk
of St. Evroul made a transcript of it, which extended through four
volumes in folio. These volumes were soon dispersed. Two of them
found their way to Rouen, where they were kept in the library of
St. Ouen: the other two were in that of the abbey of St. Maur de
Glandefeuille, on the Loire. A third, though incomplete, copy of
the original manuscript was also known to exist in France before
the revolution. It formerly belonged to Coaslin de Camboret, Bishop
of Metz, by whom it was presented, together with four thousand
manuscripts, to the monks of St. Germain des Pr&eacute;s at Paris.
But the greater part of the literary treasures of this abbey fell a
prey to the flames in July, 1793, and it is feared that the copy of
Ordericus perished at that time.</p>

<p>The original code from St. Evroul, was discovered by M. Louis
Dubois, whom I have already mentioned in connection with the ruins
of Neomagus. He is an antiquary of extensive knowledge and
extraordinary zeal. His <i>History of Lisieux</i>, which he has
long been preparing for the press, will be a work of great
curiosity and interest. The publication of it is for the present
suspended, <a name="Page_150"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;150]</span></a>whilst he superintends an
edition of the <i>Vaux-de-Vires</i>, or <i>Vaux de villes</i>, of
Olivier Basselin, an early Norman poet. Meanwhile, M. Dubois still
continues his researches among the foundations of the ancient city,
from which he has collected a number of valuable relics. Some of
the most pleasant and instructive hours of my tour have been spent
in his society; and, whilst it was under his guidance that I
visited the antiquities of Lisieux, his learning assisted me in
illustrating them. M. Dubois likewise possesses a large collection
of original autograph letters, which I found much pleasure in
perusing.</p>

<p>During the reign of Napol&eacute;on, he held the office of
librarian of Alen&ccedil;on, a situation that afforded him the
opportunity of meeting with many literary curiosities of this
nature. Among others, which thus fell into his hands, was the
following letter, written by the Princess Borghese, sister to the
Emperor, and addressed to the Empress Marie-Louise, by whom it was
received, while on a tour through the western departments. I annex
a transcript of this epistle; for, although it has no immediate
connection with the main subject of our correspondence, it yet is a
very singular contribution towards the private history of the
dynasty of Napol&eacute;on.--The odd mixture of caudle-cup
compliment and courtly flattery, is sufficiently amusing. I have
copied it, word for word, letter for letter, and point for point;
for, as we have no other specimen of the epistles of her imperial
highness, I think it right to preserve all the peculiarities of the
original; and, by, way of a treat for the collectors of autographs,
I have added a fac-simile of her signature.</p>

the county of Burgundy; but he refers for his authority to
Ordericus Vitalis, by whom it is stated to have been at Luxovium,
the name by which he always calls Lisieux; and he, in the same
page, mentions the assembly of the nobles also held there.</p>

<h4>FRENCH POLICE--RIDE FROM LISIEUX TO
CAEN--CIDER--GENERAL APPEARANCE AND TRADE OF
CAEN--ENGLISH RESIDENT THERE.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Caen, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Our reception at Caen has been somewhat inauspicious: we had
scarcely made the few necessary arrangements at the h&ocirc;tel,
and seated ourselves quietly before the <i>caff&eacute; au
lait</i>, when two gens-d'armes, in military costume, stalked
without ceremony into the room, and, taking chairs at the table,
began the conversation rather abruptly, with "Monsieur, vous
&ecirc;tes sous arr&ecirc;t."--My companions were appalled by
such a salutation, and apprehended some mistake; but the fact
turned out to be, that our passport did not bear the signature of
the mayor of Rouen, and that this ignorance of the regulations of
the French police had subjected us to so unexpected a visit. It was
too late in the day for the deficiency to be then supplied; and
therefore, after a few expostulations, accompanied with
observations, on their part, that we had the good fortune to have
fixed ourselves at an <i>honn&ecirc;te h&ocirc;tel</i>, and did not
wear the appearance of suspicious persons, the soldiers took their
leave, first exacting from me a promise, that I would present
myself the next morning before the proper officer, and would in the
meanwhile consider myself a prisoner upon my parole.</p>

<p>The impression which this occurrence could not fail to make upon
our minds, was, that the object of the gens-d'armes had been either
to extort from us money, or <a name="Page_154"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;154]</span></a>to shew their consequence; but
I have since been led to believe that they did no more than their
duty.--We have several acquaintance among the English who
reside here, and we find from the whole of them, that the utmost
strictness is practised in all matters relating to passports, and
not less towards natives than foreigners. No Frenchman can quit his
<i>arrondissement</i> unprovided with a passport; and the route he
intends to take, and the distance he designs to travel, must also
be specified. A week or two ago the prefect of the police himself
was escorted back to Caen, between a couple of gens-d'armes,
because he inadvertently paid a visit to a neighboring
bathing-place without his passport in his pocket. This is a current
story here: I cannot vouch for its authenticity; however it is
certain, that since the discovery of the late plot contrived by the
ultras, a plot whose existence is generally disbelieved, the French
police is more than usually upon the alert.</p>

<p>When I presented myself at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, to redeem
my promise, a recent decree was pointed out to me, containing a
variety of regulations which shew extraordinary uneasiness on the
part of the government, and which would seem to indicate that they
are in possession of intelligence respecting projects, that
threaten the public tranquillity<a name="FNanchor70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>. To judge from all official
proceedings, it seems as if we were walking upon a smothered <a
name="Page_155"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;155]</span></a>volcano, and yet we are told by
every body that there is not the slightest room for apprehension of
any kind.</p>

<p>This interruption has thrown me out of the regular course of my
narration.--My last letter left me still at Lisieux, from
which city to Caen the road lies through a tract of country
altogether without interest, and in most places without beauty.
During the first half of the ride, we could almost have fancied
ourselves at home in Norfolk.--About this part of the way, the
road descends through a hollow or dale, which bore the ominous name
of "<i>Coupe Gorge</i>." When Napol&eacute;on was last in Normandy,
he inquired into the origin of the appellation.--The
diligences, he was answered, "had often been stopped and robbed in
this solitary pass."--Napol&eacute;on then said, "If one
person can be made to settle here, more will follow, for it is
conveniently situated between two good towns. Let the prefect buy a
little plot of ground and build a house upon it, and give it to an
old soldier, upon condition that he shall constantly reside in it
with his family." The orders of Napol&eacute;on were obeyed. The
old soldier opened an inn, other houses arose round it, and the
cut-throat pass is now thoroughly secure. The conductor and the
post-boy tell the tale with glee whilst they drive <a name="Page_156"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;156]</span></a>through
the hamlet; and its humble dwellings will perhaps recal the memory
and fame of Napol&eacute;on Buonaparte when the brazen column of
the grand army, and the marble arch of the Thuilleries, shall have
been long levelled with the ground.--As to the character of
the landscape, I must add, that though it makes a bad picture,
there are great appearances of care in the agriculture, and of
comfort in the population. The country, too, is sufficiently well
wooded; and apple and pear trees every where take the place of the
pollard oaks and elms of our hedge-rows.</p>

<p>Norman cider is famous throughout France: it is principally,
however, the western part of the province that produces it.
Throughout the whole of that district, the lower classes of the
inhabitants scarcely use any other beverage. Vines, as I have
already had occasion to mention, were certainly cultivated, in
early times, farther to the north than they are at present. The
same proofs exist of vineyards in the vicinity of Caen and Lisieux,
as at Jumieges. Indeed, towards the close of the last century,
there was still a vineyard at Argence, only four miles south-east
of Caen; and a kind of white wine was made there, which was known
by the name of <i>Vin Huet</i>. But the liquor was meagre; and I
understand that the vineyard is destroyed.--Upon the subject
of the early use of beer in Normandy, tradition is somewhat
indistinct. The ancient name of one of the streets in Caen, <i>rue
de la Cervoisiere</i>, distinctly proves the habit of
beer-drinking; and, when Tacitus speaks of the beverage of the
Germans, in his time, as "humor ex hordeo vel frumento in quandam
similitudinem vini corruptus," it seems highly improbable <a name="Page_157"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;157]</span></a>but that
the same liquor should have been in use among the cognate tribes of
Gaul. Brito, however, expressly says of Flanders, that it is a
place where,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Raris sylva locis facit umbram, vinea nusquam:</p>

<p>&nbsp;Indigenis potus Thetidi miscetur avena,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ut vice sit vini multo confecta labore."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And the same author likewise tells us, that the Normans of his
time were cider-drinkers--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"... <i>Sicer&aelig;que</i> potatrix</p>

<p>&nbsp;Algia tumentis ...</p>

<p>&nbsp;Non tot in autumni rubet Algia tempore <i>pomis</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;Unde liquare solet <i>siceram</i> sibi <i>Neustria</i>
gratam."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Huet is of opinion, that the use of cider was first introduced
into Neustria by the Normans, who had learned it of the Biscayans,
as these latter had done from the inhabitants of the northern coast
of Africa.</p>

<p>We did not find the Norman cider at all palatable: it is
extremely sour, hard, and austere. The inhabitants, however, say
that this is not its natural character, but is attributable to the
late unfavorable seasons, which have prevented the fruit from
ripening properly.--The apple-tree and pear-tree in Normandy,
far from being ugly, and distorted, and stunted in their growth, as
is commonly seen in England, are trees of great beauty, and of
extreme luxuriance, both in foliage and ramification. The
<i>Coccus</i>, too, which has caused so much destruction among our
orchards at home, is fortunately still unknown here.</p>

<p>The only place at which we stopped between Lisieux and Caen, was
Croissanville, a poor village, but one that <a name="Page_158"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;158]</span></a>possesses a degree of
historical interest, as the spot where the battle was fought
between Aigrold, King of Denmark, and Louis d'Outremer, King of
France; a battle which seated Richard Fearnought upon the throne of
Normandy.--The country about Croissanville is an immense tract
of meadow-land; and from it the Parisian market draws a
considerable proportion of its supplies of beef. The cattle that
graze in these pastures are of a large size, and red, and all
horned; very unlike those about Caen, which latter are of small and
delicate proportions, with heads approaching to those of deer, and
commonly with black faces and legs.</p>

<p>From Croissanville to Caen the road passes through a dead flat,
almost wholly consisting of uninclosed corn-fields, extending in
all directions, with unvaried dull monotony, as far as the eye can
reach. Buck-wheat is cultivated in a large proportion of them: the
inhabitants prepare a kind of cake from this grain, of which they
are very fond, and which is said to be wholesome. Tradition,
founded principally upon the French name of this plant,
<i>sarrazin</i>, has given rise to a general belief, that
buck-wheat was introduced into France by the Moors; but this
opinion has, of late, been ably combated. The plant is not to be
found in Arabia, Spain, or Sicily; the countries more particularly
inhabited by Mahometans; and in Brittany, it still passes by the
Celtic appellation, <i>had-razin</i>, signifying <i>red-corn</i>,
of which words <i>sarrazin</i> may fairly be regarded a corruption,
as <i>buck-wheat</i>, in our own tongue, ought unquestionably to be
written <i>beech-wheat</i>; a term synonymous to what it is called
in Latin and German. The present name may well appear inexplicable,
to those <a name="Page_159"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;159]</span></a>who are unacquainted with the
Anglo-Saxon and its cognate dialects.</p>

<p>In the midst of this level country, in which even apple-trees
are scarce, stands the ancient capital of Lower Normandy, extending
from east to west in so long a line, that on our approach it
appeared to cover as much ground as Rouen, which is in fact double
its size.--From a distance, the view of Caen is grand; not
only from the apparent magnitude of the town, but from the numerous
spires and towers, that, rising from every part of it, give it an
air of great importance. Those of the abbeys of St. Stephen and the
Trinity, at opposite extremities, constitute the principal features
in the view.--The same favorable impressions continue when you
enter the town. The streets are wide, and the houses of stone; and
a stone city is a pleasing sight to eyes long accustomed to the
wooden buildings of Rouen, Bernay, and Lisieux.--Besides,
there is a certain degree of regularity in the construction of the
buildings, and some care is taken in keeping them
clean.--Lace-making is the principal occupation of females of
the lower class in Caen and the neighborhood; the streets, as we
passed along, were lined almost uninterruptedly on either side,
with a row of lace-makers; and boys were not uncommonly working
among the women. It is calculated that not fewer than twenty
thousand individuals, of all ages, from ten or twelve years old and
upwards, are thus employed; and the annual produce of their labor
is estimated at one hundred and seventy thousand pounds sterling.
Caen lace is in high estimation for its beauty and quality, and is
exported in considerable quantities.</p>

<p><a name="Page_160"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;160]</span></a></p>
<p>The present population of Caen amounts to about thirty-one
thousand individuals. The town, no longer the capital of Lower
Normandy, is still equally distinguished as the capital of the
department of the Calvados. The prefect resides here; and the royal
court of Caen comprises in its jurisdiction, not only the
department more especially appertaining to it, but also those of
the Manche and the Orne.--The situation of the town, though at
the confluence of the Orne and the Odon, is not such as can be
regarded favorable to extensive trade. The united rivers form a
stream, which, though navigable at very high tides for vessels of
two hundred tons burthen, will, on other occasions, admit only of
much smaller ones; while the channel, nearer to its mouth, is
obstructed by rocks that render the navigation difficult and
dangerous. Many plans have been projected and attempted for the
purpose of improving and enlarging the harbor, but little or no
progress has yet been made. Vauban long since pointed out the mouth
of the Orne as singularly well adapted for a naval station; and
Napol&eacute;on, in pursuance of this idea, actually commenced the
excavation of a basin under the walls of the town, and intended to
deepen the bed of the river, thinking it best to make a beginning
in this direction. All idea, however, of prosecuting such a plan is
for the present abandoned.--Other engineers have proposed the
junction of the Orne with the Loire by means of a canal, which
would be of the greatest importance to France, not only by
facilitating internal commerce, but by saving her vessels the
necessity of coasting Capes Finisterre, and la Hogue, and thus
enabling them <a name="Page_161"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;161]</span></a>to avoid a navigation, which is
at all times dangerous, and in case of war peculiarly exposed.</p>

<p>For minor purposes, however, for mills and manufactories of
different kinds, Caen is certainly well situated; being in almost
every direction intersected with streams, owing to the repeated
ramifications of the Odon, some of which are artificial, and of as
early a date as the eleventh century. The same circumstance
contributes materially to the pleasantness of the town; for the
banks of the river are in many places formed into walks, and
crowned by avenues of noble trees.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_37"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_37.png" height="471" width="680" alt="Head-Dress of Females, at Caen" /></p>

<p>The <i>grand cours</i> at Caen is almost as fine a promenade as
that at Rouen. On Sunday evening it was completely crowded. The
scene was full of life and gaiety, and very varied. All the females
of the lower rank, and many of the higher orders, were dressed in
the costume of the country, which commonly consists of a scarlet
gown and deep-blue apron, or <i>vice versâ</i>. Their hair,
which is usually powdered, is combed entirely back from every part
of their faces, and tucked up behind. The snow-white cap which
covers it is beautifully plaited, and has longer lappets than in
the Pays de Caux. Mr. Cotman sketched the <i>coiffure</i> of the
chamber-maid, at the H&ocirc;tel d'Espagne, in grand costume, and I
send his drawing to you.--The men dress like the English; but
do not therefore fancy that you or I should have any chance of
being mistaken for natives, even if we did not betray ourselves by
our accent. Here, as every where else, our countrymen are
infallibly known: their careless slouching gait is sure to mark
them; and the police keep <a name="Page_162"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;162]</span></a>a watchful eye upon them. Caen
is at present frequented by the English: those indeed, who, like
the Virgilian steeds, "stare loco nesciunt," seldom shew themselves
in Lower Normandy; but above thirty British families have taken up
their residence in this town: they have been induced to do so
principally by the cheapness of living, and by the advantages held
out for the education of their children. A friend of mine, who is
of the number of temporary inhabitants, occupies the best house in
the place, formerly the residence of the Duc d'Aumale; and for
this, with the garden, and offices, and furniture of all kinds,
except linen and plate, he pays only nine pounds a month. For a
still larger house in the country, including an orchard and garden,
containing three acres, well stocked with fruit-trees, he is asked
sixty pounds from this time to Christmas. But, cheap as this
appears, the expence of living at Coutances, or at Bayeux, or
Valognes, is very much less.</p>

<p>Were I obliged to seek myself a residence beyond the limits of
our own country, I never saw a place which I should prefer to Caen.
I should not be tempted to look much farther before I said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Sis me&aelig; sedes utinam senect&aelig;:"--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The historical recollections that are called forth at almost
every turn, would probably have some influence in determining my
choice; the noble specimens of ancient architecture which happily
remain, unscathed by wars and Calvinists and revolutions, might
possibly have more; but the literary resources which the town
affords, the <a name="Page_163"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;163]</span></a>pleasant society with which it
abounds, and, above all, the amiable character of its inhabitants,
would be my great attraction.--At present, indeed, we have not
been here sufficiently long to say much upon the subject of society
from our own experience; but the testimony we receive from all
quarters is uniform in this point, and the civilities already shewn
us, are of a nature to cause the most agreeable prepossessions. It
is not our intention to be hurried at Caen; and I shall therefore
reserve to my future letters any remarks upon its history and its
antiquities. To a traveller who is desirous of information, the
town is calculated to furnish abundant materials.</p>

<h4>HISTORIANS OF CAEN--TOWERS AND
FORTIFICATIONS--CH&Acirc;TEAU DE LA
GENDARMERIE--CASTLE--CHURCHES OF ST. STEPHEN, ST.
NICHOLAS, ST. PETER, ST. JOHN, AND ST. MICHEL DE VAUCELLES.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Caen, August,</i> 1818.)</p>

<p>France does not abound in topographical writers; but the history
and antiquities of Caen have been illustrated with singular
ability, by men to whom the town gave birth, and who have treated
their subject with equal research and fidelity--these are
Charles de Bourgueville, commonly called the Seigneur de Bras, and
the learned Huet, Bishop of Avranches.</p>

<p>De Bourgueville was a magistrate of Caen, where he resided
during almost the whole of the sixteenth century. The religious
wars were then raging; and he relates, in a most entertaining and
artless manner, the history of the events of which he was an
eye-witness. His work, as is justly observed by Huet, is a
treasure, that has preserved the recollection of a great variety of
the most curious details, which would otherwise have been neglected
and forgotten. Every page of it is stamped with the character of
the author--frankness, simplicity, and uprightness. It abounds
in sound morality, sage maxims, and proofs of excellent principles
in religion and politics; and, if the writer occasionally carries
his <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> to excess, it is to be recollected
that the book was published when he was in his eighty-fifth year, a
period of life when indulgence may reasonably be claimed. He died
<a name="Page_165"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;165]</span></a>four years subsequently, in
1593.--In Huet's work, the materials are selected with more
skill, and are digested with more talent. The author brought to his
task a mind well stored with the learning requisite for the
purpose, and employed it with judgment. But he has confined
himself, almost wholly, to the description of the town; and the
consequence is, that while the bishop's is the work most commonly
referred to, the magistrate's is that which is most generally read.
The dedication of the former to the town of Caen, does honor to the
feelings of the writer: the portrait of the latter, prefixed to his
volume, and encircled with his quaint motto, <i>"L'heur de grace
use l'oubli,"</i> itself an anagram upon his name, bespeaks and
insures the good will of the reader.</p>

<p>The origin of Caen is uncertain.--Its foundation has been
alternately ascribed to Phoenicians, Romans, Gauls, Saxons, and
Normans. The earliest historical fact connected with the town, is
recorded in an old chronicle of Normandy<a name="FNanchor71"></a><a
href="#Footnote_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>, written in 1487, by
William de Talleur, of Rouen. The author, in speaking of the
meeting between Louis d'Outremer, King of France, and Richard Ist,
Duke of Normandy, about the year 945, enumerates Caen among the
good towns of the province. Upon this, Huet observes that,
supposing Caen to have been at that time only recently founded, it
must have acquired importance with much rapidity; for, in the
charter, by which Richard IIIrd, Duke of Normandy, granted a dowery
to Adela, daughter of Robert, King of France, whom he married in
1026, Caen is not only stated as one of the <a name="Page_166"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;166]</span></a>portions
of the dower, but its churches, its market, its custom-house, its
quay, and its various appurtenances are expressly mentioned; and
two hundred years afterwards, Brito in his <i>Philippiad</i>, puts
Caen in competition with Paris,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Villa potens, opulenta situ, spatiosa, decora,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Fluminibus, pratis, et agrorum fertilitate,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Merciferasque rates portu capiente marino,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Seque tot ecclesiis, domibus et civibus ornans,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ut se Parisio vix annuat esse minorem."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Caen is designated in Duke Richard's charter, by the appellation
of "in Bajocensi comitatu villa qu&aelig; dicitur <i>Cathim</i>,
super fluvium Oln&aelig;."--From <i>Cathim</i>, came
<i>Cahem</i>; and <i>Cahem</i>, in process of time, was gradually
softened into <i>Caen</i>. The elision that took place in the first
instance, is of a similar nature to that by which the Italian words
<i>padre</i> and <i>madre</i>, have been converted into
<i>p&egrave;re</i> and <i>m&egrave;re</i>; and the alteration in
the latter case continued to be indicated by the di&aelig;resis,
which, till lately, separated the two adjoining
vowels.--Towards the latter part of the eleventh century, Caen
is frequently mentioned by the monkish historians, in whose Latin,
the town is styled <i>Cadomus</i> or <i>Cadomum</i>.--And here
ingenious etymologists have found a wide field for conjecture:
Cadomus, says one, was undoubtedly founded by Cadmus; another, who
hesitates at a Phoenician antiquity, grasps with greater eagerness
at a Roman etymon, and maintains that <i>Cadomus</i> is a
corruption from <i>Caii domus</i>, fully and sufficiently proving
that the town was built by Julius C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p><a name="Page_167"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;167]</span></a></p>
<p>Robert Wace states, in his <i>Roman de Rou</i>, that, at the
time immediately previous to the conquest of England, Caen was an
open town.--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Encore ert Caen sans Châtel,</p>

<p>&nbsp;N'y avoit mur, ny quesnel."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Wace is a competent witness; for he lived during the reign
of Henry Ist, to whom he dedicated his poem. Philip de Valois, in
1346, allowed the citizens to surround the town with ditches,
walls, and gates. This permission was granted by the king, on the
application of the inhabitants, Caen, as they then complained,
being still open and unfortified. Hence, the fortifications have
been considered to be the work of the fourteenth century, and,
generally speaking, they were unquestionably, of that time; but it
is equally certain, that a portion was erected long before.</p>

<p>A proof of the antiquity of the fortifications may perhaps be
found in the name of the tower called <i>la Tour Guillaume le
Roi</i>, which stands immediately behind St. Peter's, and was
intended to protect the river at the extremity of the walls,
dividing the town from the suburb of Vaugeux. This tower is
generally supposed to be the oldest in the fortifications. Its
masonry is similar to that of the wall with which it is connected,
and which is known to have been built about the same time as the
abbey of St. Stephen. The appearance of it is plain, massy, and
rugged; and it forms a picturesque object. Such also is the <i>Tour
au Massacre</i>, which is situated at the confluence of the Orne
and Odon. The <a name="Page_168"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;168]</span></a>tower in question is said to
have received its gloomy title from a massacre, of which our
countrymen were guilty, at the time when the town was taken in
1346. There is, however, reason to believe that this tale is a mere
fiction. Huet, at the same time that he does not venture so far to
oppose popular belief, as altogether to deny the truth of the story
of the massacre, adds, that the original name of the tower was
<i>la Tour Machart</i>, and suspects its present appellation to be
no more than a corruption of the former one. Renauld Machart was
bailiff of Caen two years prior to the capture of the place by
Edward IIIrd; and the probability is, that the tower was erected by
him in those times of alarm, and thus took his name. It has been
supposed that the figure sculptured upon it, may also be intended
for a representation of Machart himself.</p>

<p>Caen contains another castellated building, which might easily
mislead the studious antiquarian. The <i>Château de
Calix</i>, as it is sometimes called, is situated at the extremity
of the suburb known by that name; and the curious inhabitants of
Caen usually suppose that it was erected for the purpose of
commanding the river, whilst it flowed in its ancient, but now
deserted, bed; or, at least, that it replaces such a fortification.
According to the learned Abb&eacute; de la Rue, however, and he is
a most competent authority, no real fortification ever existed
here; but the castle was raised in conformity to the caprice of
Girard de Nollent, the wealthy owner of the property, who
flourished towards the beginning of the sixteenth
century.--Girard de Nollent's mansion is now occupied by a
farmer. It has four fronts. The windows <a name="Page_169"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;169]</span></a>are square-headed, and
surrounded by elegant mouldings; but the mullions have been
destroyed. One medallion yet remains over the entrance; and it is
probable that the walls were originally covered with ornaments of
this kind. Such, at least, is the case with the towers and walls,
which, surrounding the dwelling, have given it a castellated
aspect. The circular tower nearest the gate forms the subject of
the accompanying sketch: it is dotted on all sides with busts in
basso-relievo, enclosed in medallions, and of great diversity of
character. One is a frowning warrior, arrayed in the helmet of an
emperor of the lower empire; another, is a damsel attired in a
ruff; a third, is a turbaned turk. The borders of the medallions
are equally diversified: the <i>cordeli&egrave;re</i>, well known
in French heraldry, the vine-leaf, the oak-leaf, all appear as
ornaments. The battlements are surmounted with two statues,
apparently Neptune, or a sea-god, and Hercules. These heathen
deities not being very familiar to the good people of Caen, they
have converted them, in imagination, into two gens-d'armes,
mounting guard on the castle; and hence it is frequently called the
<i>Château de la Gendarmerie</i>. Some of the busts are
accompanied by inscriptions--"Vincit pudicitiam mors;" "Vincit
amor pudicitiam;" "Amor vincit mortem;" and all seem to be either
historical or allegorical. The battlements of the curtain-wall are
ornamented in the same manner. The farther tower has less
decoration, and is verging to decay. I have given these details,
because the castle of Calix is a specimen of a style of which we
have no fair parallel in England, and the workmanship is far from
being contemptible.</p>

<p><a name="Page_170"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;170]</span></a></p>
<p>In the Rue St. Jean is a house with decorations, in the same
style, but more sumptuous, or, perhaps I ought rather to say, more
perfect. Both of them are most probably of nearly the same date:
for it was principally during the reigns of Charles VIIIth and
Louis XIIth, that the practice prevailed in France, of ornamenting
the fronts of houses with medallions. The custom died away under
Francis Ist.</p>

<p>I must now return to more genuine fortifications.--When the
walls of Caen were perfect, they afforded an agreeable and
convenient promenade completely round the town, their width being
so great, that three persons might with ease walk abreast upon
them. De Bourgueville tells us that, in his time, they were as much
frequented as the streets; and he expatiates with great pleasure
upon the gay and busy prospect which they commanded,</p>

<p>The castle at Caen, degraded as it is in its character by modern
innovation, is more deserving of notice as an historical, than as
an architectural, relic. It still claims to be ranked as a place of
defence, though it retains but few of its original features. The
spacious, lofty, circular towers, known by the names of the black,
the white, the red, and the grey horse, which flanked its ramparts,
have been brought down to the level of the platform. The dungeon
tower is destroyed. All the grandeur of the Norman castle is lost;
though the width of its ditches, and the thickness of its walls,
still testify its ancient strength. I doubt whether any castle in
France covers an equal extent of ground. Monstrelet and other
writers have observed, that this single fortress exceeded in size
the towns of Corbeil or of Montferrand; and, indeed, <a name="Page_171"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;171]</span></a>there
are reasons for supposing that Caen, when first founded, only
occupied the site of the present castle; and that, when it became
advisable to convert the old town into a fortress, the inhabitants
migrated into the valley below. Six thousand infantry could be
drawn up in battle-array within the outer ballium; and so great was
the number of houses and of inhabitants enclosed within its area,
that it was thought expedient to build in it a parochial church,
dedicated to St. George, besides two chapels.</p>

<p>One of the chapels is still in existence, though now converted
to a store-house; and the Abb&eacute; de la Rue considers it as an
erection anterior to the conquest, and, belonging to the old town
of Caen. Its choir is turned towards the west, and its front to the
east.--The religious edifices upon the continent do not
preserve the same uniformity as our English ones, in having their
altars placed in the direction of the rising sun; but this at Caen
is a very remarkable instance of the position of the entrance and
the altar being completely reversed<a name="FNanchor72"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>. The <a name="Page_172"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;172]</span></a>door-way
is a fine semi-circular arch: the side pillars supporting it are
very small, but the decorations of the archivolt are rich: they
consist principally of three rows of the chevron moulding, enclosed
within a narrow fillet of smaller ornaments, approaching in shape
to quatrefoils. Collectively, they form a wide band, which springs
from flat piers level with the wall, and does not immediately unite
with the head of the inner arch. The intermediate space is covered
by a reticulated pattern indented in the stone. Above the entrance
is a window of the same form, its top encircled by a broad
chequered band, a very unusual accompaniment to this style of
architecture. The front of the chapel presents in other respects, a
flat uniform surface, unvaried, except by four Norman buttresses,
and a string-course of the simplest form, running round the whole
building, at somewhat less than mid-height. The sides of the chapel
are lighted by a row of circular-headed windows, with columns in
the angles; and between these windows are buttresses, as in the
chapel of the lazar-house of St. Julien, at Rouen.</p>

<p>Huet endeavours to prove that the first fortress which was built
at Caen, was erected by William the Conqueror, who frequently
resided here with his Queen Matilda, and who was likely to find
some protection of this nature desirable, as well to guard his
royal residence against the mutinous disposition of the lords of
the Bessin, as to command the navigation of the Orne. The castle
was enlarged and strengthened by his son Henry; but it is believed
that the four towers, just mentioned, and the walls surrounding the
keep, were added by our countrymen, during that short period when
the Norman sceptre <a name="Page_173"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;173]</span></a>was again wielded by the
descendants of the Norman dukes. Under Louis XIIth and Francis Ist,
the whole of the castle, but particularly the dungeon, underwent
great repairs, by which the original form of the structure was
entirely changed.--From that period history is silent
respecting the fortress. I cannot, however, take leave of it
without reminding you, that Sir John Fastolf, whilom our neighbour
at Castor, was for some time placed in command here, as Lieutenant
to the Regent Duke of Bedford. You, who are acquainted with the
true character of the knight, need scarcely be told, that even his
enemies concur in bearing testimony to his ability, his vigilance,
and his valor: it is to be regretted that he has not met with equal
justice at home. Not one individual troubles himself about history,
whilst a thousand read the drama; and the stains which Shakspeare's
pen has affixed to the name of Fastolf, are of a nature never to be
wiped away; thus disproving the distich of the satyrist, who
indeed, by his own works, has effectually falsified his own maxim,
that--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Truth will survive when merry jokes are past;</p>

<p>&nbsp;For rising merit must buoy up at last."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As usual, the buildings dedicated to religion are far more
numerous and valuable than the relics of military architecture. Of
these, the first which salutes the stranger who enters by the great
high road, is the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, which is almost intact and
unaltered. The basement story contains large and deep pointed
arches, ornamented with the chevron moulding, disposed in a very
peculiar manner.--From the style of the building, there is
every reason <a name="Page_174"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;174]</span></a>to believe that it is of the
beginning of the thirteenth century, at which time William, Count
of Magneville, appropriated to charitable purposes the ground now
occupied by this hospital, and caused his donation to be confirmed
by a bull from Pope Innocent IIIrd, dated in April, 1210.</p>

<p>The abbeys, the glories of Caen, will require more leisure: at
present let us pass on to the parochial churches. Of these, the
most ancient foundation is <i>St. Etienne le Vieil</i>; and
tradition relates that this church was dedicated by St. Renobert,
bishop of Bayeux, in the year 350.--But, though the present
edifice may stand upon the site of an ancient one, there would be
little risk in affirming, that not one stone of it was laid upon
another till after the year 1400. The building is spacious, and its
tower is not devoid of beauty. The architecture is a medley of
debased gothic and corrupted Roman; but the large pointed windows,
decorated by fanciful mouldings and scroll-work, have an air of
richness, though the component parts are so inharmonious.</p>

<p>Attached to the wall of the choir of this church is still to be
seen an equestrian statue<a name="FNanchor73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>, part of the celebrated group
supposed to represent William the Conqueror making his triumphal
entry into Caen. A headless horse, mounted by a headless rider, and
a figure, which has lost all shape and form, beneath the feet of
the steed, are all that now remain; but De Bourgueville, who knew
the group when perfect, says, that there likewise belonged to it a
man and woman upon their knees, as if seeking some explanation for
the death of their child, or rather, <a name="Page_175"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;175]</span></a>perhaps, in the act of
imploring mercy.--I have already pointed out the resemblance
between these statues and the bas-relief, of which I have sent you
a sketch from St. Georges. One of the most learned antiquaries of
the present time has found a prototype for the supposed figure of
the Duke, among the sculptures of the Trajan column. But this, with
all due deference, is far from a decisive proof that the statue in
question was not intended for William. Similar adaptations of the
antique model, "mutato nomine," frequently occur among the works of
the artists of the middle ages; and there is at least a possibility
that, had the face been left us, we might have traced some attempt
at a portrait of the Norman Duke. Upon the date of the sculpture,
or the style of the workmanship, I dare not venture an opinion.
There are antiquaries, I know, (and men well qualified to judge,)
who believe it Roman: I have heard it pronounced from high
authority, that it is of the eleventh century, others suspect that
it is Italian, of the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries; whilst M.
Le Prevost and M. De Gerville maintain most strenuously that it is
not anterior to the fifteenth. De Bourgueville certainly calls it
"une antiquit&eacute; de grand remarque;" but we all know that any
object which is above an hundred years old, becomes a piece of
antiquity in the eye of an uncritical observer; and such was the
good magistrate.</p>

<p>The church of St. Nicholas, now used as a stable, was built by
William the Conqueror, in the year 1060, or thereabouts. Desecrated
as it is, it remains entire; and its interior is remarkable for the
uniformity of the plan, the symmetry of the proportions. All the
capitals <a name="Page_176"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;176]</span></a>of the pillars attached to the
walls are alike; and those of the arches, which very nearly
resemble the others, are also all of one pattern. In the
side-aisles there is no groining, but only cross vaulting. The
vaulting of the nave is pointed, and of late introduction. Round
the choir and transepts runs a row of small arches, as in the
triforium.--The west end was formerly flanked by two towers,
the southern of which only remains. This is square, and well
proportioned: each side contains two lancet windows. The lower part
is quite plain, excepting two Norman buttresses. The whole of the
width of the central compartment, which is more than quadruple that
of either of the others, is occupied below by three circular
portals, now blocked up.--Above them are five windows,
disposed in three tiers. In the lowest are two not wider than
loop-holes: over these two others, larger; another small one is at
the top. All these windows are of the simplest construction,
without side pillars or mouldings.--The choir of the church
ends in a semi-circular apsis, divided into compartments by a row
of pillars, rising as high as the cornice: in the intercolumniation
are windows, and under the windows small arches, each of which has
its head hewn out of a single stone.--The roof of the choir is
of stone, and the pitch of it is very high.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have the exact counterpart of the Irish
stone-roofed chapels, the most celebrated of which, that of Cormac,
in Cashel Cathedral, appears, from all the drawings and
descriptions I have seen of it, to be altogether a Norman building.
Ledwich asserts that "this chapel is truly Saxon, and was erected
prior to the <a name="Page_177"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;177]</span></a>introduction of the Norman, and
gothic styles<a name="FNanchor74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>." If, we agree with him, we only
obtain a proof that there is no essential difference between Norman
and Saxon architecture; and this proposition, I believe, will soon
be universally admitted. We now know what is really Norman; and a
little attention to the buildings in the north of Germany, may
terminate the long-debated questions, relative to Saxon
architecture and the origin of the stone-roofed chapels in the
sister isle.</p>

<p>In the burial-ground that surrounds the church of St. Nicholas,
are several monumental inscriptions, all of them posterior to the
commencement of the reign of Napol&eacute;on, and all, with one
single exception, commemorative of females. The epitaphs are much
in the same tone as would be found in an English church-yard. The
greater part, however, of the tomb-stones, are uninscribed. They
are stone coffins above-ground, sculptured with plain crosses, or,
where they have been raised to ecclesiastics, with an addition of
some portion of the sacerdotal dress.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_39"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_39.png" height="532" width="340" alt="Tower and Spire of St. Peter's Church, at Caen" /></p>

<p>Among the churches of comparatively modern erection, St. Peter
deserves most attention. From every part of the town and
neighborhood, its lofty spire, towering above the surrounding
buildings, forces itself upon your view. It is not easy to carry
accurate ideas of height in the memory; but, as far as recollection
will serve me, I should say that its elevation is hardly inferior
to that of the spire of Salisbury cathedral. I have no hesitation
in adding, <a name="Page_178"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;178]</span></a>that the proportions of the
tower and spire of the church at Caen, are more pleasing. Elegance,
lightness, and symmetry, are the general characters of the whole,
though the spire has peculiar characters of its own.--The
tower, though built a century later than that of Salisbury, is so
much less ornamented, that it might be mistaken for an earlier
example of the pointed style. The lowest story is occupied wholly
by a portal: the second division is surrounded by pointed arches,
beneath crocketed gables: the third is filled by four lancet
arches, supported by reeded pillars, so lofty, that they occupy
nearly two-thirds of the entire height of the tower. The flanking
arches are blanks: the two middle ones are pierced into windows,
divided by a central mullion. The balustrade at the top of the
tower is of a varied pattern, each side exhibiting a different
tracery. Eight crocketed pinnacles are added to the spire, which is
octangular, and has a row of crockets at each angle. From the base
to the summit it is encircled, at regular distances, with broad
bands of stone-work, disposed like scales; and, alternating with
the bands, are perforations in the form of cinquefoils,
quatrefoils, and trefoils, diminishing as the spire rises, but so
disposed, that the light is seen distinctly through them. The
effect of these perforations was novel and very pleasing.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_40"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_40.png" height="469" width="309" alt="Sculpture upon a Capital in St. Peter's Church at Caen" /></p>

<p>This tower and spire were built in the year 1308, under the
directions of Nicolle L'Anglois, a burgher of Caen, and treasurer
of the church.--How far we are at liberty to infer from his
name, as Ducarel does, that he was an Englishman, may admit of some
doubt. He was <a name="Page_179"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;179]</span></a>buried here; and De
Bourgueville has preserved his epitaph, which recounts among his
other merits, that</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Et par luy, et par sa devise</p>

<p>&nbsp;Fut la tour en sa voye mise</p>

<p>&nbsp;D'estre faicte si noblement."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the name of the architect who was employed is
unrecorded.--The rest of the church was erected at different
periods: the northern aisle in 1410; the opposite one some time
afterwards; and the eastern extremity, with the vaulted roof of the
choir and aisles, in 1021.--With this knowledge, it is not
difficult to account for the diversity of styles that prevails in
the building.--The western front contains much good tracery,
and well disposed, apparently as old as the tower.--The
exterior of the east end, with its side-chapels, is rather Italian
than gothic.--The interior is of a purer style: the five
arches forming the apsis are perhaps amongst the finest specimens
of the luxuriant French gothic: roses are introduced with great
effect amongst the tracery and friezes, with which the walls are
covered. The decorations of the chapels round the choir, although
they display a tendency towards Italian architecture, are of the
most elaborate arabesque. The niches are formed by escalop shells,
swelling cylinders of foliage, and scrolls: some of the pendants
from the roofs are of wonderfully varied and beautiful
workmanship.--The nave has nothing remarkable, saving the
capital of one of the side pillars. Its sculptures, with the
exception of one mutilated group, have been drawn by Mr.
Cotman.--The subjects are strangely inappropriate, as the
ornaments of a sacred edifice. All are borrowed from
romance.--Aristotle bridled <a name="Page_180"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;180]</span></a>and saddled by the mistress of
Alexander. Virgilius, or, as some say, Hippocrates, hanging in the
basket. Lancelot crossing the raging flood.--The fourth, which
is not shewn in the sketch, is much defaced, but seems to have been
taken from the <i>Chevalier et la Charette</i>. According to the
usual fate of ancient sculpture, the <i>marguilliers</i> of the
parish have so sadly encumbered it with white-wash, that it is not
easy to make out the details; and a friend of mine was not quite
certain whether the bearded figure riding on the lion, was not a
youthful Cupid. No other of the capitals has at present any
basso-relievo of this kind; but I suspect they have been chopped
off. The church suffered much from the Calvinists; and afterwards,
during the revolution, when most of the bas-reliefs of the portal
were destroyed.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_41"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_41.png" height="482" width="324" alt="Tower of St. John's Church, at Caen" /></p>

<p>The neighboring church of St. John appears likewise to be the
work of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This building and
St. Peter's agree in general character: their towers are nearly the
counterparts of each other. But, in St. John's, the great tower is
placed at the west end of the edifice, the principal portal being
beneath it. This is not very usual in the Norman-gothic churches,
though common in England. The tower wants a spire; and, at present,
it leans considerably out of the perpendicular line, so that some
apprehensions are entertained for its safety. It was originally
intended that the church should also be surmounted by a central
tower; and, as De Bourgueville says, the beginning was made in his
time; but it remains to the present day incomplete, and has not
been raised sufficiently high to enable us to form a clear idea of
the design of the architect, though enough <a name="Page_181"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;181]</span></a>remains to shew that it
would have been built in the Romanizing-gothic style.--The
inside is comparatively plain, excepting only the arches in the
lower open part of the tower. These are richly ornamented; and a
highly-wrought balustrade runs round the triforium, uniform in its
pattern in the nave and choir, but varying in the
transepts.--In the other ecclesiastical buildings at Caen, we
saw nothing to interest us.--The chapel of St. Thomas
l'Abattu, which, according to Huet, "had existed from time
immemorial," and which, to judge from Ducarel's description and
figure, must have been curious, has now entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>In the suburb of Vaucelles, the church of St. Michael contains
some architectural features of great curiosity<a name="FNanchor75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>. The
circular-headed arches in the short square tower, and in a small
round turret that is attached to it, are unquestionably early
Norman, and are remarkable for their proportions, being as long and
as narrow as the lancet windows of the following &aelig;ra. It
would not be equally safe to pronounce upon the date of the
stone-roofed pyramid which covers this tower. The north porch is
entered by a pointed arch, which, though much less ornamented,
approaches in style to the southern porch of St. Ouen, and, like
that, has its inner archivolt fringed with pendant trefoils. The
wall above the arch rises into a triangular gable, entirely covered
with waving tracery, the only instance of the kind which I have
seen at Caen.</p>

this subject, Huet has an extraordinary observation, (<i>Origines

plausible grounds; but I am at a loss where to find them. Bingham,

churches were so placed, that the front, or chief entrances, were
towards the west, and the sanctuary or altar placed towards the
east;" and though he adduces instances of a different position, as
in the church of Antioch, which faced the east, and that of St.
Patrick, at Sabul, near Down in Ulster, which stood from north to
south, he cites them only as deviations from an established

<h4>ROYAL ABBEYS OF THE HOLY TRINITY AND ST. STEPHEN--FUNERAL
OF THE CONQUEROR, EXHUMATION OF HIS REMAINS, AND DESTRUCTION OF HIS
MONUMENT.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Caen, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>The two royal abbeys of Caen have fortunately escaped the storms
of the revolution. These buildings are still standing, an ornament
to the town, and an honor to the sovereign who caused them to be
erected, as well as to the artist who planned, and to the age which
produced them. As models of architecture they are the same
land-marks to the history of the art in Lower Normandy, as the
church of St. Georges is in the upper division of the province.
Their dates are equally authenticated; and the characteristic
features in each are equally perfect.</p>

<p>Both these noble edifices rose at the same time, and from the
same motive. William the Conqueror, by his marriage with Matilda,
daughter of Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, had contracted an alliance
proscribed by the degrees of consanguinity. The clergy inveighed
against the union; and they were supported in their complaints by
Lanfranc, then resident at Bec, whose remonstrances were so
uncourtly and strenuous, that the duke banished him from the
province. It chanced that the churchman, while in the act of
obedience to this command, met the sovereign. Their interview began
with recriminations: it ended with reconciliation; and Lanfranc
finally engaged to undertake a mission to the supreme Pontiff, who,
considering the turbulent disposition of the Normans, and that a
better end was likely to be answered by peaceable <a name="Page_183"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;183]</span></a>than by
hostile measures, consented to grant the necessary dispensation. At
the same time, by way of penance, he issued an injunction that the
royal pair should erect two monasteries, the one for monks, the
other for nuns. And in obedience to this command, William founded
the abbey of St. Stephen, and Matilda, the abbey of the Holy
Trinity; or, as they are usually called at Caen, <i>l'abbaye aux
hommes</i>, and <i>l'abbaye aux dames</i>.</p>

<p>The approach to the monastery of the Trinity is through a
spacious gate-tower, part of the original structure. Over the rent
and shapeless door-way are three semi-circular arches, upon the
capitals of which is distinctly observable the cable-moulding, and
along the top of the tower runs a line of the same toothed
ornament, remarked by Ducarel at Bourg-Achard, and stated by him to
have been considered peculiar to Saxon architecture<a name="FNanchor76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>. The
park that formerly environed the abbey retains its character,
though abandoned to utter neglect. It is of great extent, and is
well wooded. The monastic buildings, which are, as usual, modern,
are mostly perfect.--A ruined wall nearly in front of the
church, with a chimney-piece, perhaps of Norman workmanship,
belonged to the old structure. Such part of the chimney wall as was
exposed to the flame is built of large tiles, placed diagonally.
All other vestiges of the ancient apartments have been removed.</p>

<p>The noble church<a name="FNanchor77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> is now used as a work-house for
the department. At the revolution it became national property, and
it remained unappropriated, till, upon the <a name="Page_184"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;184]</span></a>institution of the Legion
of Honor, Napol&eacute;on applied it to some purpose connected with
that body, by whom it was lately ceded for it present object. But,
if common report may be credited, it is likely soon to revert to
its original destination. The restoration may be easily effected,
as the building has sustained but little injury. A floor has been
thrown across the nave and transept, dividing them into two
stories; but in other respects they are unaltered, and divine
service is still performed in the choir.</p>

<p>A finer specimen of the solid grandeur of Norman architecture is
scarcely to be found any where than in the west front of this
church. The corresponding part of the rival abbey of St. Stephen is
poor when compared to it; and Jumieges and St. Georges equally fail
in the comparison. In all of these, there is some architectural
anomaly: in the Trinity none, excepting, indeed, the balustrade at
the top of the towers; and this is so obviously an addition of
modern times, that no one can be misled by it. This balustrade was
erected towards the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the
oval apertures and scrolls seen in Ducarel's print were introduced.
Anciently the towers were ornamented with very lofty spires.
According to some accounts, these were demolished, because they
served as land-marks to the English cruizers, being seen far out at
sea; but other accounts state, that the spires were pulled down by
Charles, King of Navarre, who was at war with his namesake, Charles
Vth, then Dauphin and Regent. The abbey at that time bore the
two-fold character of nunnery and fortress.--Strangely
inconsistent as this union may appear, the fact is undoubted. Even
now a portion of the fosses <a name="Page_185"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;185]</span></a>remains; and the gate-way
indicates an approach to a fortified place. Ancient charters
likewise expressly recognize the building in both capacities: they
endow the abbey for the service of God; and they enjoin the
inhabitants of the adjacent parishes to keep the fortifications in
repair against any assaults of men. Nay, letters patent, granted by
Charles Vth, which fix the salary of the captain of the <i>Fort of
the Trinity, at Caen</i>, at one hundred francs per annum, are yet
extant.</p>

<p>I shall attempt no description of the west front of this
monastery, few continental buildings being better known in England.
The whole remains as it was in the time of Ducarel, except that the
arches of entrance are blocked up, and modern windows have been
inserted in the door-ways.--The north side of the church is
quite concealed by the cloisters and conventual buildings. The
southern aisle has been plastered and patched, and converted into a
range of work-shops, so that its original elevation is wholly
obliterated. But the nave, which rises above, is untouched by
innovation. The clerestory range is filled by a row of
semi-circular headed windows, separated by intervening flat
buttresses, which reach to the cornice. Each buttress is edged with
two slender cylindrical pilasters; and each window flanked by two
smaller arches, whose surfaces are covered with chequer-work. The
arch of every window has a key-stone, formed by a grotesque
head.--Above the whole is a corbel-table that displays
monsters of all kinds, in the form of beasts, and men scarcely less
monstrous.--The semi-circular east end is divided in its
elevation into three compartments. The lower contains a row of
small blank arches: in each of the other two is a window, of a size
unusually <a name="Page_186"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;186]</span></a>large for a Norman building,
but still without mullions or tracery; its sides ornamented with
columns, and its top encircled with a broad band of various
mouldings. The windows are separated by cylindrical pillars,
instead of buttresses.--In the upper part of the low central
tower are some pointed arches, the only deviations of style that
are to be found in the building. To the extremity of the southern
transept has been attached a Grecian portico, which masks the
ancient portal. Above is a row of round arches, some of which are
pierced into windows.</p>

<p>Of the effect of the nave and transept within, it is difficult
now to obtain a correct idea, the floor intervening to obstruct a
general view.--High arches, encircled with the embattled
moulding below; above these, a wide billeted string-course, forming
a basis for a row of smaller arches, without side-pillars or
decoration of any kind; then another string-course of different and
richer patterns; and over this, the triforium, consisting also of a
row of small arches, supported by thick pillars;--such is the
elevation of the sides of the nave; and the same system is
continued with but small variation in the transepts. But,
notwithstanding the general uniformity of the whole, no two
compartments are precisely alike; and the capitals are infinitely
varied. It is singular to see such a playfulness of ornament in a
building, whose architect appears, at first view, to have
contemplated only grandeur and solidity.--The four arches
which support the central tower are on a magnificent scale. The
archivolts are encircled by two rows of lozenged squares, indented
in the stone. The rams, or rams' heads, upon the capitals of these
piers, are peculiar. The eastern arch rises higher than the rest,
and is obtusely pointed; yet it seems to be of the <a name="Page_187"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;187]</span></a>same
date with its circular companions.--So exquisite, however, is
the quality of the Caen stone, that no opinion drawn from the
appearance of the material, ought to be hazarded with confidence.
Seven centuries have elapsed since this church was erected, and
there is yet no difference to be discovered in the color of the
stone, or the sharpness of the work; the whole is as clean and
sharp as if it were but yesterday fresh from the chisel. The
interior of the choir has not been divided by the flooring; and the
eastern extremity, which remains perfect, shews the original
design. It consists of large arches, disposed in a double tier, so
as to correspond with the windows of the apsis, and placed at a
short distance from the wall; but without any Lady-Chapel beyond.
The pillars that support these arches are well proportioned: the
sculptures on their capitals are scarcely less grotesque than those
at St. Georges; but, barbarous as they are, the corners of almost
every capital are finished with imitations, more or less obvious,
of the classical Ionic volute.--Among the sculptures is a head
resting upon two lions, which has been fancied to be a
representation of the Conqueror himself; whilst a faded painting of
a female, attired as a nun, on the north side of the altar, is also
commonly entitled a portrait of the foundress.--Were any
plausible reason alleged for regarding the picture as intended to
bear even an imaginary resemblance to Matilda, I would have sent
you a copy of it; but there appear no grounds to consider it as
authentic.--Willing, however, to contribute a mark of respect
to a female, styled by William of Malmesbury, "f&aelig;minam
prudenti&aelig; speculum, pudoris culmen," and, by way of a
companion to the rough sketch of her illustrious <a name="Page_188"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;188]</span></a>consort,
in the initial letter in the library at Rouen, I add the fac-simile
of a seal, which, by the kindness of a friend has fallen into my
hands. It has been engraved before, but only for private
distribution; and, if a suspicion should cross your mind, that it
may have belonged to the Empress Maud, or to Matilda, wife to
Stephen, I can only bespeak your thanks to me, for furnishing you
with a likeness of any one of these ladies.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_16"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_16.png" height="293" width="353" alt="Fac-simile of seal" /></p>

<p>Matilda was interred in the middle of this choir; and, according
to Ordericus Vitalis, a monument of exquisite workmanship, richly
ornamented with gold and precious stones, and bearing a long
inscription in letters of gold, was raised to her memory. Her
effigy was afterwards <a name="Page_189"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;189]</span></a>added to the monument; the
whole of which was destroyed in 1652, by the Calvinists, who tore
open the Queen's coffin, and dispersed her remains. After a lapse
of an hundred and forty years, the royal bones were again
collected, and deposited in this church. At the same time, the
splendid monument was replaced by a plain altar-tomb, which existed
till the revolution, when all was once more swept away. The marble
slab, inscribed with the original epitaph, alone remained entire,
and was carried to the abbey church of St. Stephen's, where it
still forms a part of the pavement in a chapel. The letters are
finely sculptured and perfectly sharp. However, it is not likely to
continue there long; for Count de Montlivault, the prefect of the
department, has already caused a search to be made for Matilda's
remains, and he intends to erect a third monument to her memory.
The excavations for this purpose have hitherto been unsuccessful:
the Count met with many monumental stones, and many coffins of
various kinds, but none that could be mistaken for the desired
object; for one of the inscriptions on the late monument expressly
states, that the Queen's bones had been wrapped in a linen cloth,
and enclosed in a leaden box.</p>

<p>The inquiry, however, will not be discontinued<a name="FNanchor78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a>: there
are still hopes of success, especially in the crypt, which <a name="Page_190"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;190]</span></a>corresponds in its architecture
with the church above. It is filled with columns placed in four
ranges, each standing only four feet from the other, all of elegant
proportions, with diversified capitals, as those in the
choir.--<a name="Page_191"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;191]</span></a>Round it runs a stone bench, as
in the subterraneous chapel in St. Gervais, at Rouen.</p>

<p>Founded by a queen, the abbey of the Trinity preserved at all
times a constitution thoroughly aristocratical. No individual,
except of noble birth, was allowed to take the veil here, or could
be received into the community. You will see in the series of the
abbesses the names of Bourbon, Valois, Albret, Montmorenci, and
others of the most illustrious families in France. Cecily, the
Conqueror's eldest daughter, stands at the head of the list.
According to the <i>Gallia Christiana</i>, she was devoted by her
parents to this holy office, upon the very day of the dedication of
the convent, in July 1066.</p>

<p>The black marble slab which covered her remains, was lately
discovered in the chapter-house. A crozier is sculptured upon it.
It is delineated in a very curious volume now in the possession of
the Abb&eacute; de la Rue, which contains drawings of all the tombs
and inscriptions that formerly existed in the abbey.</p>

<p>The annual income of the monastery of the Trinity is stated by
Gough, in his <i>Alien Priories</i>, at thirty thousand livres, and
that of the monastery of St. Stephen, at sixty thousand; but
Ducarel estimates the revenue of the former at seventy thousand,
and of the latter at two hundred thousand; and I should not doubt
but that the larger sums are nearest the truth; indeed, the grants
and charters still in existence, or noticed by historians, would
rather lead to the supposition that the revenues must have been
even greater. Parsimony in the endowment of religious buildings,
was not a prevailing vice in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
Least of all was it likely that it should be <a name="Page_192"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;192]</span></a>practised in the case of
establishments, thus founded in expiation of the transgressions of
wealthy and powerful sinners. Page after page, in the charters, is
filled with the list of those, who, with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Lands and livings, many a rood,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Had gifted the shrine for their soul's repose."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The privileges and immunities enjoyed by these abbeys were very
extensive. Both of them were from their origin exempted by Pope
Alexander IInd, with the consent of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, from all
episcopal jurisdiction; and both had full power, as well spiritual
as ecclesiastical, over the members of their own communities, and
over the parishes dependent upon them; with no other appeal than to
the archbishop of Rouen, or to the Pope. Express permission was
likewise given to the abbot of St. Stephen's, by virtue of a bull
from Pope Clement VIIth, to wear a gold mitre studded with precious
stones, and a ring and sandals, and other episcopal ornaments.</p>

<p>Many of the monuments and deeds of the greater abbey are now in
the prefecture of the department. The original chartulary or
register was saved by the Abb&eacute; de la Rue, and is at this
time preserved in his valuable collection. The charters of the
Trinity were hid, during the revolution, by the nuns, who secreted
them beneath the tiling of a barn. They were discovered there not
long since; but damp and vermin had rendered them wholly
illegible.</p>

<p>Lanfranc, whose services at Rome well deserved every distinction
that his sovereign could bestow, was the first abbot of St.
Stephen's. Upon his translation to the see <a name="Page_193"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;193]</span></a>of Canterbury, he was
succeeded by William, who was likewise subsequently honored with an
archiepiscopal mitre. The third abbot, Gislebert, was bishop of
Evreux; and, though the series was not continued through an
uninterrupted line of equal dignity, the office of abbot of this
convent was seldom conferred, except upon an individual of exalted
birth. Eight cardinals, two of them of the noble houses of Medici
and Farnese, and three others, still more illustrious, the
cardinals Richelieu, Mazarine, and Fleury, are included in the
list, though in later times the abbacy was held <i>in commendam</i>
by these powerful prelates, whilst all the internal management of
the house devolved upon a prior. Amongst the abbots will also be
found Hugh de Coilly, grandson of King Stephen, Anthony of Bourbon,
a natural son of Henry IVth of France, and Charles of
Orl&eacute;ans, who was likewise of royal extraction.--St.
Stephen was selected as the patron of the abbey, in consequence of
the founder having bestowed upon it the head of the protomartyr,
together with one of his arms, and a phial of his blood, and the
stone with which he was killed.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_42"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_42.png" height="337" width="574" alt="Monastery of St. Stephen, at Caen" /></p>

<p>The monastic buildings now serve for what, in the language of
revolutionary and imperial France, was called a
<i>Lyc&eacute;e</i>, but which has since assumed the less heathen
appellation of a college. They constitute a fine edifice, and, seen
from a short distance, in conjunction with the east end of the
church, they form a grand <i>tout-ensemble</i>. The abbey church,
from this point of view, has somewhat of an oriental character: the
wide sweep of the semi-circular apsis, and the slender turrets and
pyramids that <a name="Page_194"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;194]</span></a>rise from every part of the
building, recal the idea of a Mahometan mosque. But the west end is
still more striking than the east; and if, in the interior of the
church of the Trinity, we had occasion to admire the beautiful
quality of the Caen stone, our admiration of it was more forcibly
excited here: notwithstanding the continual exposure to wind and
weather, no part appears corroded, or discolored, or injured. A
character of magnificence, arising in a great measure from the
grand scale upon which it is built, pervades this front. But, to be
regarded with advantage, it must be viewed as a whole: the parts,
taken separately, are unequal and ill assorted. The simplicity of
the main division approaches to meanness. Its three door-ways and
double tier of windows appear disproportionally small, when
contrasted with the expanse of blank wall; and their returns are
remarkably shallow. The windows have no mouldings whatever, and the
pillars and archivolts of the doors are very meagre. The front
consists of three compartments, separated by flat buttresses; the
lateral divisions rising into lofty towers, capped with octagon
spires. The towers are much ornamented: three tiers of
semi-circular arches surround the upper divisions; the arches of
the first tier have no mouldings or pillars; the upper vary in
pattern, and are enriched with pillars and bands, and some are
pierced into windows.--Twelve pinnacles equally full of
arches, some pointed, others semi-circular, surround each spire.
Similar pinnacles rise from the ends of the transepts and the
choir.--The central tower, which is short and terminates in a
conical roof, was ruined by the <a name="Page_195"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;195]</span></a>Huguenots, who undermined it,
thinking that its fall would destroy the whole building.
Fortunately, however, it only damaged a portion of the eastern end;
the reparations done to which have occasioned a discrepancy of
style, that is injurious to the general effect. But the choir and
apsis were previously of a different &aelig;ra from the rest of the
edifice. They were raised by the Abbot Simon de Trevieres, in the
beginning of the fourteenth century.--I am greatly mistaken,
if a real Norman church ever extended farther eastward than the
choir.</p>

<p>The building is now undergoing a thorough repair, at the expence
of the town. No other revenues, at present, belong to it, except
the <i>sous</i> which are paid for chairs during mass.</p>

<p>A friend, who is travelling through Normandy, describes the
interior in the following manner; and, as I agree with him in his
ideas, I shall borrow his description:--"Without doubt, the
architect was conversant with Roman buildings, though he has
Normanized their features, and adopted the lines of the basilica to
a <i>barbaric</i> temple. The Coliseum furnished the elevation of
the nave;--semi-circular arches surmounted by another tier of
equal span, and springing at nearly an equal height from the basis
of the supporting pillars. The architraves connecting the lower
rows of pillars are distinctly enounced. The arches which rise from
them have plain bold mouldings. The piers between each arch are of
considerable width. In the centre of each pier is a column, which
ascends as usual to the vault. These columns are alternately simple
and compound. The latter are square <a name="Page_196"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;196]</span></a>pilasters, each fronted by a
cylindrical column, which of course projects farther into the nave
than the simple columns; and thus the nave is divided into bays.
This system is imitated in the gothic cathedral, at Sens. The
square pilaster ceases at about four-fifths of its height: then two
cylindrical pillars rise from it, so that, from that point, the
column becomes clustered. Angular brackets, sculptured with knots,
grotesque heads, and foliage, are affixed to the base of these
derivative pillars. A bold double-billeted moulding is continued
below the clerestory, whose windows adapt themselves to the binary
arrangement of the bays. A taller arch is flanked by a smaller one
on the right or the left side, as its situation requires. These are
supported by short massy pillars: an embattled moulding runs round
the windows.</p>

<p>"In the choir the arches become pointed, but with Norman
mouldings: the apsis is a re-construction. In that portion of the
choir, which seems original, there are pointed windows formed by
the interlacing of circular arches: these light the gallery.</p>

<p>"The effect produced by the perspective of the interior is lofty
and palatial. The ancient masonry of the exterior is worthy of
notice. The stones are all small, perhaps not exceeding nine or
twelve inches: the joints are about three-quarters of an inch."</p>

<p>At the north-west angle of the nave has been built a large
chapel, comparatively a modern erection; and in the centre of this
lies Matilda's gravestone.--There is no other chapel to the
nave, and, as usual, no monument in any portion of the church; but
in front of the high <a name="Page_197"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;197]</span></a>altar is still to be seen the
flat stone, placed there in 1742, in memory of the Conqueror, and
bearing the epitaph--</p>

<p>The poetical part of this epitaph was composed by Thomas,
archbishop of York, and was engraved upon the original monument, as
well as upon a plate of gilt <a name="Page_198"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;198]</span></a>copper, which was found within
the sepulchre when it was first opened. Many other poets, we are
told by Ordericus Vitalis, exercised their talents upon the
occasion; but none of their productions were deemed worthy to be
inscribed upon the tomb. The account of the opening of the vault is
related by De Bourgueville, from whom it has been already copied by
Ducarel; but the circumstances are so curious, that I shall offer
no apology for telling a twice-told tale. From Ordericus Vitalis
also we may borrow some details respecting the funeral of the
Conqueror, which, though strictly appertaining to English history,
have never yet, I believe, appeared in an English dress.</p>

<p>In speaking of the church of St. Gervais at Rouen, I have
already briefly alluded to the melancholy circumstances by which
the death of this monarch was attended. The sequel of the story is
not less memorable.</p>

<p>The king's decease was the signal for general consternation
throughout the metropolis of Normandy. The citizens, panic struck,
ran to and fro, as if intoxicated, or as if the town were upon the
point of being taken by assault. Each asked counsel of his
neighbor, and each anxiously turned his thoughts to the concealing
of his property. When the alarm had in some measure subsided the
monks and clergy made a solemn procession to the abbey of St.
Georges, where they offered their prayers for the repose of the
soul of the departed Duke; and archbishop William commanded that
the body should be carried to Caen, to be interred in the church of
St. Stephen, which William had founded. But the lifeless king was
now deserted by all who had participated <a name="Page_199"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;199]</span></a>in his munificence and
bounty. Every one of his brethren and relations had left him; nor
was there even a servant to be found to perform the last offices to
his departed lord. The care of the obsequies was finally undertaken
by Herluin, a knight of that district, who, moved by the love of
God and the honor of his nation, provided at his own expence,
embalmers, and bearers, and a hearse, and conveyed the corpse to
the Seine, whence it was carried by land and water to the place of
its destination.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the funeral train at Caen, it was met by
Gislebert, bishop of Evreux, then abbot of St. Stephen's, at the
head of his monks, attended with a numerous throng of clergy and
laity; but scarcely had the bier been brought within the gates,
when the report was spread that a dreadful fire had broken out in
another part of the town, and the Duke's remains were a second time
deserted. The monks alone remained; and, fearful and irresolute,
they bore their founder "with candle, with book, and with knell,"
to his last home. Ordericus Vitalis enumerates the principal
prelates and barons assembled upon this occasion; but he makes no
mention of the Conqueror's son, Henry, who, according to William of
Jumieges, was the only one of the family that attended, and was
also the only one worthy of succeeding to such a father.--Mass
had now been performed, and the body was about to be committed to
the ground, "ashes to ashes, dust to dust," when, previously to
this closing part of the ceremony, Gislebert mounted the pulpit,
and delivered an oration in honor of the deceased.--He praised
his valor, which had so widely extended the limits of the Norman
dominion; his ability, which had <a name="Page_200"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;200]</span></a>elevated the nation to the
highest pitch of glory; his equity in the administration of
justice; his firmness in correcting abuses; and his liberality
towards the monks and clergy; then, finally, addressing the people,
he besought them to intercede with the Almighty for the soul of
their prince, and to pardon whatsoever transgression he might have
been guilty of towards any of them.--At this moment, one
Asselin, an obscure individual, starting from the crowd, exclaimed
with a loud voice, "the ground upon which you are standing, was the
site of my father's dwelling. This man, for whom you ask our
prayers, took it by force from my parent; by violence he seized, by
violence he retained it; and, contrary to all law and justice, he
built upon it this church, where we are assembled. Publicly,
therefore, in the sight of God and man, do I claim my inheritance,
and protest against the body of the plunderer being covered with my
turf."--The appeal was attended with instant effect; bishops
and nobles united in their entreaties to Asselin; they admitted the
justice of his claim; they pacified him; they paid him sixty
shillings on the spot by way of recompence for the place of
sepulture; and, finally, they satisfied him for the rest of the
land.</p>

<p>But the remarkable incidents doomed to attend upon this burial,
were not yet at an end; for at the time when they were laying the
corpse in the sarcophagus, and were bending it with some force,
which they were compelled to do, in consequence of the coffin
having been made too short, the body, which was extremely
corpulent, burst, and so intolerable a stench issued from the
grave, that all the perfumes which arose from all the censers of
the priests and acolytes were of no avail; and the rites were <a
name="Page_201"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;201]</span></a>concluded in haste, and the
assembly, struck with horror, returned to their homes.</p>

<p>The latter part of this story accords but ill with what De
Bourgueville relates. We learn from this author, that four hundred
and thirty years subsequent to the death of the Conqueror, a Roman
cardinal, attended by an archbishop and bishop, visited the town of
Caen, and that his eminence having expressed a wish to see the body
of the duke, the monks yielded to his curiosity, and the tomb was
opened, and the corpse discovered in so perfect a state, that the
cardinal caused a portrait to be taken from the lifeless
features.--It is not worth while now to inquire into the truth
of this story, or the fidelity of the resemblance. The painting has
disappeared in the course of time: it hung for a while against the
walls of the church, opposite to the monument; but it was stolen
during the tumults caused by the Huguenots, and was broken into two
pieces, in which state De Bourgueville saw it a few years
afterwards, in the hands of a Calvinist, one Peter Hod&eacute;, the
gaoler at Caen, who used it in the double capacity of a table and a
door.--The worthy magistrate states, that he kept the picture,
"because the abbey-church was demolished."</p>

<p>He was himself present at the second violation of the royal
tomb, in 1572; and he gives a piteous account of the transaction.
The monument raised to the memory of the Conqueror, by his son,
William Rufus, under the superintendance of Lanfranc, was a
production of much costly and elaborate workmanship: the shrine,
which was placed upon the mausoleum, glittered with gold and silver
and precious stones. To complete the whole, the effigy of the king
had been added to <a name="Page_202"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;202]</span></a>the tomb, at some period
subsequent to its original erection.--A monument like this
naturally excited the rapacity of a lawless banditti, unrestrained
by civil or military force, and inveterate against every thing that
might be regarded as connected with the Catholic worship.--The
Calvinists were masters of Caen, and, incited by the information of
what had taken place at Rouen, they resolved to repeat the same
outrages. Under the specious pretext of abolishing idolatrous
worship, they pillaged and ransacked every church and monastery:
they broke the painted windows and organs, destroyed the images,
stole the ecclesiastical ornaments, sold the shrines, committed
pulpits, chests, books, and whatever was combustible, to the fire;
and finally, after having wreaked their vengeance upon eyery thing
that could be made the object of it, they went boldly to the
town-hall to demand the wages for their labors.--In the course
of these outrages the tomb of the Conqueror at one abbey, and that
of Matilda at the other, were demolished. And this was not enough;
but a few days afterwards, the same band returned, allured by the
hopes of farther plunder. It was customary in ancient times to
deposit treasures of various kinds in the tombs of sovereigns, as
if the feelings of the living passed into the next stage of
existence;--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"... qu&aelig; gratia curr&ucirc;m</p>

<p>&nbsp;Armorumque fuit vivis, qu&aelig; cura nitentes</p>

<p>&nbsp;Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tellure repostos."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The bees that adorned the imperial mantle of Napol&eacute;on
were found in the tomb of Childeric. A similar expectation excited
the Huguenots, at Caen. They dug up the coffin: the hollow stone
rung to the strokes of their <a name="Page_203"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;203]</span></a>daggers: the vibration proved
that it was not filled by the corpse; and nothing more was wanted
to seal its destruction.</p>

<p>De Bourgueville, who went to the spot and exerted his eloquence
to check this last act of violence, witnessed the opening of the
coffin. It contained the bones of the king, wrapped up in red
taffety, and still in tolerable preservation; but nothing else. He
collected them, with care, and consigned them to one of the monks
of the abbeys who kept them in his chamber, till the Admiral de
Châtillon entered Caen at the head of his mercenaries, on
which occasion the whole abbey was plundered, and the monks put to
flight, and the bones lost. "Sad doings, these," says De
Bourgueville, "<i>et bien peu r&eacute;formez!</i>"--He adds,
that one of the thigh-bones was preserved by the Viscount of
Falaise, who was there with him, and begged it from the rioters,
and that this bone was longer by four fingers' breadth than that of
a tall man. The bone thus preserved, was re-interred, after the
cessation of the troubles: it is the same that is alluded to in the
inscription, which also informs us that a monument was raised over
it in 1642, but was removed in 1742, it being then considered as an
incumbrance in the choir.</p>

<p>With this detail I close my letter. The melancholy end of the
Conqueror, the strange occurrences at his interment, the violation
of his grave, the dispersion of his remains, and the demolition and
final removal of his monument, are circumstances calculated to
excite melancholy emotions in the mind of every one, whatever his
condition in life. In all these events, the religious man traces
the hand of retributive justice; the philosopher regards the
nullity <a name="Page_204"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;204]</span></a>of sublunary grandeur; the
historian finds matter for serious reflection; the poet for
affecting narrative; the moralist for his tale; and the school-boy
for his theme.--Ordericus Vitalis sums the whole up admirably.
I should spoil his language were I to attempt to translate it; I
give it you, therefore, in his own words:--"Non fictilem
tragoediam venundo, non loquaci comoedia cachinnantibus parasitis
faveo: sed studiosis lectoribus varios eventus veraciter intimo.

detailed account of the proceedings on this occasion, is given in
the <i>Journal Politique du D&eacute;partement du Calvados</i>, for
March 21, and May 6, 1819.--The first attempt at the discovery
of Matilda's coffin, was made in March, 1818, and was confined to
the chapter-house: the matter then slept till the following March,
when Count de Montlivault, attended by the Bishop of Bayeux, Mr.
Spencer Smythe, and other gentlemen, prosecuted his inquiries
within the church itself, and, immediately under the spot where her
monument stood, discovered a stone coffin, five feet four inches
long, by eleven inches deep, and varying in width from twenty
inches to eleven. Within this coffin was a leaden box, soldered
down; and, in addition to the box, the head of an effigy of a monk,
in stone, and a portion of a skull-bone filled with aromatic herbs,
and covered with a yellowish-white membrane, which proved, upon
examination, to be the remains of a linen cloth. The box contained
various bones, that had belonged to a person of nearly the same
height as Matilda is described to have been. No doubt seemed to
remain but that the desideratum was discovered. The whole was
therefore carefully replaced; and the prefect ordered that a new
tomb should be raised, similar to that which was destroyed at the
revolution; and that the slab, with the original epitaph, should be
laid on the top; that copies of the former inscription, stating how
the queen's remains had been re-interred by the abbess, in 1707,
should be added to two of the sides; that to the third should be
affixed the ducal arms of Normandy; and that the fourth should bear
the following inscription:--</p>

<div class="poem">

<h4>PALACE OF THE CONQUEROR--HERALDIC TILES--PORTRAITS OF
WILLIAM AND MATILDA--MUSEUM--PUBLIC
LIBRARY--UNIVERSITY--ACADEMY--EMINENT
MEN--HISTORY OF CAEN.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Caen, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Within the precincts of the abbey of St. Stephen are some
buildings, which do not appear to have been used for monastic
purposes. It is supposed that they were erected by William the
Conqueror, and they are yet called his palace. Only sixty years
ago, when Ducarel visited Caen, these remains still preserved their
original character.</p>

<p>He describes the great guard-chamber and the barons' hall, as
making a noble appearance, and as being perhaps equally worth the
notice of an English antiquary as any object within the province of
Normandy. The walls of these rooms are standing, but dilapidated
and degraded; and they have lost their architectural character,
which, supposing Ducarel's plate to be a faithful representation,
must have been very decisive. It is scarcely possible to conceive
how any man, with such a specimen of the palace before his eyes,
could dream of its being coeval with the Norman conquest: every
portion is of the pointed style, and even of a period when that
style was no longer in its purity. Possibly, indeed, other parts of
the edifice may have been more ancient; such certainly was the
"Conqueror's kitchen," a singular octagon building, with four tall
slender chimneys capped with <a name="Page_206"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;206]</span></a>perforated cones. This was
destroyed many years ago; but Ducarel obtained an original drawing
of it, which he has engraved. Amongst the ruins there is a chimney
which perhaps belonged to this building.--The guard-chamber
and barons' hall are noble rooms: the former is one hundred and
ninety feet in length and ninety in breadth. You remember how
admirably the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i> opens with a
description of such a hall, filled with knights, and squires, and
pages, and all the accompaniments of feudal state. I tried, while
standing by these walls, to conjure up the same pictures to my
imagination, but it was impossible; so desolate and altered was
every thing around, and so effectually was the place of baronial
assemblage converted into a granary. The ample fire-place still
remains; but, cold and cheerless, it looks as if had been left in
mockery of departed splendor and hospitality. I annex a sketch of
it, in which you will also see a few scattered tiles, relics of the
magnificent pavement that once covered the floor.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_43"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_43.png" height="579" width="445" alt="Fireplace in the Conqueror's Palace, at Caen" /></p>

<p>This pavement has been the subject of much learned discussion;
because, if the antiquity of the emblazoned tiles could be
established, (which it certainly cannot) we should then have a
decisive proof of the use of armorial bearings in the eleventh
century. Nearly the whole of these tiles are now removed. After the
abbey was sold, the workmen entirely destroyed the tiles, breaking
them with their pick-axes. The Abb&eacute; de la Rue, however,
collected an entire set of them; and others have been preserved by
M. Lair, an antiquary of Caen.--Ducarel thus describes the
pavement when perfect: "The floor is laid with tiles, each near
five inches square, baked <a name="Page_207"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;207]</span></a>almost to vitrification. Eight
rows of these tiles, running from east to west, are charged with
different coats of arms, said to be those of the families who
attended Duke William in his invasion of England. The intervals
between each of these rows are filled up with a kind of tessellated
pavement, the middle whereof represents a maze or labyrinth, about
ten feet in diameter, and so artfully contrived that were we to
suppose a man following all the intricate meanders of its volutes,
he could not travel less than a mile before he got from one end to
the other. The remainder of the floor is inlaid with small squares
of different colors, placed alternately, and formed into draught or
chess-boards, for the amusement of the soldiers while on
guard."</p>

<p>Such is the general description of the floors of this apartment:
with regard to the date of the tiles, Ducarel proceeds to state
that "it is most probable the pavement was laid down in the latter
part of the reign of King John, when he was loitering away his life
at Caen, with the beautiful Isabel of Angoul&ecirc;me, his queen;
during which period, the custom of wearing coats of arms was
introduced."--Common tradition assigns the tiles to higher
date, making them coeval with the conquest; and this opinion has
not been without supporters. It was strenuously defended by Mr.
Henniker Major, who, in the year 1794, printed for private
distribution, two letters upon the subject, addressed to Lord
Leicester, in which he maintained this opinion with zeal and
laborious research. To the letters were annexed engravings of
twenty coats of arms, the whole, as he observes, that <a name="Page_208"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;208]</span></a>were
represented on the pavement; for though the number of emblazoned
tiles was considerable, the rest were all repetitions<a name="FNanchor80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>. The
same observation was found in the inscription attached to a number
of the tiles, which the monks kept framed for public inspection, in
a conspicuous part of the monastery; and yet some of the armorial
bearings in this very selection, differ from any of those figured
by Mr. Henniker Major. The Abb&eacute; de la Rue has also many
which are not included in Mr. Henniker Major's engravings. In one
of the coats the arms are quartered, a practice that was not
introduced till the reign of Edward IIIrd. The same quarterings are
also found upon an escutcheon, placed over the door that leads to
the apartment. This door is a flattened arch, with an ogee canopy,
the workmanship probably of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>To the same date I should also refer the tiles; and possibly the
whole palace was built at that period. There are no records of its
erection; no document connects its existence with the history of
the duchy; no author relates its having been suffered to fall into
decay. So striking an absence of all proof, and this upon a point
where evidence of different kinds might naturally have been
expected, may warrant a suspicion how far the building was ever a
royal palace, according to the strict import of <a name="Page_209"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;209]</span></a>the
town. A friend of mine supposes that these buildings may have been
the king's lodgings. During the middle ages it was usual for
monarchs in their progresses, to put up at the great abbeys; and
this portion of the convent of St. Stephen may have been intended
for the accommodation of the royal guests.</p>

<p>The assigning of a comparatively modern date to the pavement,
does not necessarily interfere with the question as to the
antiquity of heraldic bearings. The coats of arms which are painted
upon the tiles may have been designed to represent those of the
nobility who attended Duke William on his expedition to England: it
is equally possible that they embraced a more general object, and
were those of the principal families of the duchy--De Thou
gives his suffrage in favor of the former opinion, but Huet of the
latter; and the testimony of the bishop must be allowed, in this
case, to outweigh that of the president.--Huet also says, that
it is matter of notoriety that the tiles were laid down towards the
close of the fourteenth century. He mentions, however, no authority
for the assertion; and less credit perhaps will be given to it than
it deserves, from his having stated just before, that the abbey and
palace were contemporary structures.</p>

<p>Upon the outside wall of a chapel that is supposed to have
belonged to the same palace, were ancient fresco paintings of
William and Matilda, and of their sons, Robert and William Rufus.
They are engraved by Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>, and are supposed by him,
probably with reason, to be coeval with the personages they
represent. <a name="Page_210"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;210]</span></a>The figures are standing upon
animals, the distribution of which is the most remarkable
circumstance connected with the portraits. To the king is assigned
a dog; to the queen a lion: the eldest son has the same symbol as
his father; the younger rests upon a two-bodied beast, half swine,
half bird, the bodies uniting in a female head.--Upon the same
plate, Montfaucon has given a second whole-length picture of the
conqueror, which represents him with the crown upon his head, and
the sceptre in his hand. Considering the costume, he observes with
justice that it cannot have been painted earlier than the latter
part of the fourteenth century. Ducarel, who, as usual, has copied
the Benedictine's engravings, says that, in his time, the same
portrait existed in fresco over a chimney-piece in the porter's
lodge.--We saw two copies of it; the one in the sacristy of
the abbey church, the other in the museum, an establishment which
may, without injustice to the honors of Caen, be dismissed with the
brief observation, that, though three rooms are appropriated to the
purpose, there is a very scanty assortment of pictures, and their
quality is altogether ordinary.</p>

<p>The public library is a handsome apartment, one hundred and
thirty feet in length, and it contains about twenty thousand
volumes, mostly in good condition; but a great proportion of the
books are of a description little read, being old divinity. To the
students of the university, this establishment is of essential
service; and on this account it is to be regretted, that the very
scanty revenue with which it is endowed, amounting only to twelve
hundred francs per annum, prevents the possibility of any material
increase to <a name="Page_211"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;211]</span></a>the collection, except in the
case of such books as the liberality of the state contributes. And
these are principally works of luxury and great expence, which
might advantageously be exchanged for the less costly productions
of more extensive utility. We inquired in vain after manuscripts
and specimens of early typography. None were to be found; and yet
they might surely have been expected here; for a public library has
existed in Caen from an early part of the last century, and,
previous to the revolution, it was enriched with various donations.
M. de Colleville presented to it the whole of the collection of the
celebrated Bochart; Cavelier, printer to the university, a man
known by several treatises on Roman antiquities, added a donation
of two thousand volumes; and Cardinal de Fleury, who considered it
under his especial protection, gave various sums of money for the
purchase of books, and likewise provided a salary for the
librarian. I suspect that no small proportion of the more valuable
volumes, have been dispersed or stolen. Round the apartment hang
portraits of the most eminent men of Caen: tablets are also
suspended, for the purpose of commemorating those who have been
benefactors to the library; but the tablets at present are
blank.</p>

<p>For its university Caen is indebted to Henry VIth, who, anxious
to give &eacute;clat and popularity to British rule, founded a
college by letters patent, dated from Rouen, in January, 1431. The
original charter restricted the objects of the university to
education in the canon and civil law; but, five years subsequently,
the same king issued a fresh patent, adding the faculties of
theology and the arts; and, in the following year, he <a name="Page_212"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;212]</span></a>still
farther added the faculty of medicine.--To give permanency to
the work thus happily begun, the states of Normandy preferred their
petition to Pope Eugene IVth, who issued two bulls, dated the
thirtieth of May, 1437, and the nineteenth of May, 1439, by which
the new university received the sanction of the holy see, and was
placed upon the same footing as the other universities of the
kingdom. The Bishop of Bayeux was at the same time appointed
chancellor; and sundry apostolical privileges were conceded, which
have been confirmed by subsequent pontiffs.--Thus Normandy, as
is admitted by De Bourgueville, owed good as well as evil to her
English sovereigns; but Charles VIIth had no sooner succeeded in
expelling our countrymen from the province, than jealousy arose in
his breast, at finding them in possession of such a title to the
gratitude of the people, and he resolved to run the risk of
destroying what had been done, rather than lose the opportunity of
gratifying his personal feeling. The university was therefore
dissolved in 1450, that a new one might hereafter be founded by the
new sovereign. The king thought it necessary to vary in some degree
from the example of his predecessor; and for this purpose he had
recourse to the extraordinary expedient of abolishing the faculty
of law. A petition, however, from the states, induced him to
replace the whole upon its original footing in 1452, and it
continued till the time of the revolution to have all the five
faculties, and to be the only one in France that retained them. Two
years only intervened between the dates of the patents issued by
Charles VIIth, upon the subject of this university; yet there is a
remarkable difference in their language. The first of them, <a
name="Page_213"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;213]</span></a>which is obviously intended to
disparage Caen, styles it a large town, scantily inhabited, without
manufactures or commerce, and destitute of any great river to
afford facilities towards the transport of the produce of the
country. The second was designed to have an opposite tendency; and
in this, the people of Caen are praised for their acuteness, and
the town for its excellent harbor and great rivers. The patent also
adds, that the nearest university, that of Paris, is fifty leagues
distant.</p>

<p>In the estimation, at least, of the inhabitants, the university
of Caen ranks at present the third in France; Paris and Strasbourg
being alone entitled to stand before it. The faculty of law retains
its old reputation, and the legal students are quite the pride of
the university. Since the peace, many young jurisprudents from
Jersey and Guernsey have resorted to it. Medical students generally
complete their education at Paris, where it is commonly considered
in France, that, both in theory and practice, the various branches
of this faculty have nearly attained the acm&egrave; of perfection.
The students, who amount to just five hundred, are under the care
of twenty-six professors, many of them men of distinguished
talents. The Abb&eacute; de la Rue fills the chair of history; M.
Lamouroux, that of the natural sciences. They receive their
salaries wholly from the government; their emoluments continue the
same, whether the students crowd to hear their courses, or whether
they lecture to empty benches. It is strictly forbidden to a
student to attempt to make any remuneration to a professor, or even
to offer him a present of any kind. The whole of the dues paid by
the scholars go to the state; and the state in its turn, defrays
the expences of the establishment.</p>

<p><a name="Page_214"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;214]</span></a></p>
<p>There is likewise at Caen an Academy of Sciences, Arts and
Belles Lettres, which has published two volumes; not, strictly
speaking, of its Transactions, but exhibiting a brief outline of
the principal papers that have been read at the meetings. The
antiquarian dissertations of the Abb&eacute; de la Rue, which they
contain, are of great merit; and it is much to be regretted, that
they have not appeared in a more extended form. A chartered academy
was first founded here in the year 1705; and it continued to exist,
till it was suppressed, like all others throughout France, at the
revolution. The present establishment arose in 1800, under the
auspices of General Dugua, then prefect of the department, who had
been urged to the task by the celebrated Chaptal, Minister of the
Interior.--Some interesting, letters are annexed to the second
part of the poems of Mosant de Brieux, in which, among much curious
information relative to Caen, he describes the literary meetings
that led to the foundation of the first academy. The town at that
time could boast an unusual proportion of men of talents. Bochart,
author of <i>Sacred Geography</i>; Graindorge, who had published
<i>De Principiis Generation&icirc;s</i>; Huet, a man seldom
mentioned, without the epithet <i>learned</i> being attached to his
name; and Halley and M&eacute;nage, authors almost equally
distinguished, were amongst those who were associated for the
purposes of acquiring and communicating information.</p>

<p>Indeed, Caen appears at all times to have been fruitful in
literary characters. Huet enumerates no fewer than one hundred and
thirty-seven, whom he considers worthy of being recorded among the
eminent men of France. The greater part of them are necessarily
unknown to us in England; and allowance must be made for a man who
is <a name="Page_215"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;215]</span></a>writing upon a subject, in
which self-love may be considered as in some degree involved; the
glory of our townsmen shining by reflection upon ourselves. A
portion, however, of the number, are men whose claims to celebrity
will not be denied.--Such, in the fifteenth century, were the
poets John and Clement Marot; such was the celebrated physician,
Dalechamps, to whom naturalists are indebted for the <i>Historia
Plantarum</i>; such the laborious lexicographer, Constantin; and,
not to extend the catalogue needlessly, such above all was
Malherbe. The medal that has been struck at Caen in honor of this
great man, at the expence of Monsieur de Lair, bears for its
epigraph, the three first words of Boileau's eulogium--"Enfin
Malherbe vint."--The same inscription is also to be seen upon
the walls of the library. So expressive a beginning prepares the
reader for a corresponding sequel; and I should be guilty of
injustice towards this eminent writer, were I not to quote to you
the passage at length.--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Enfin, Malherbe vint, et le premier en France</p>

<p>&nbsp;Fit sentir dans les vers une juste cadence:</p>

<p>&nbsp;D'un mot mis en sa place enseigna le pouvoir,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Et reduisit la muse aux r&egrave;gles du devoir.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Par ce sage &eacute;crivain, la langue repare&eacute;,</p>

&eacute;pure&eacute;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Et le Vers sur le Vers n'osa plus enjamber."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Wace and Baudius, though not born at Caen, have contributed to
its honor, by their residence here. Baudius was appointed to the
professorship of law in the university, by the President de Thou;
but he disagreed with his colleagues, <a name="Page_216"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;216]</span></a>and soon removed to
Leyden, where he filled the chair of history till his death. Some
of his earlier letters, in the collection published by Elzevir, are
dated from Caen. His Iambi, directed against his brethren of this
university, are scarcely to be exceeded for severity, by the
bitterest specimens of a style proverbially bitter. Their excessive
virulence defeated the writer's aim; but there is an elegance in
the Latinity of Baudius, and a degree of feeling in his sentiments,
which will ensure a permanent existence to his compositions, and
especially to his poems.--He it was who called forth the
severe saying of Bayle, that "many men of learning render
themselves contemptible in the places where they live, while they
are admired where they are known only by their
writings."--Wace was a native of Jersey, but an author only at
Caen. The most celebrated of his works is <i>Le Roman de Rou et des
Normans</i>, written in French verse. He dedicated this romance to
our Henry IInd, who rewarded him with a stall in the cathedral at
Bayeux.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_44"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_44.png" height="419" width="323" alt="Profile of M. Lamouroux" /></p>

<p>Quitting the departed for the living, I send you a profile of M.
Lamouroux, the professor of natural history at this university, to
whom we have been personally indebted for the kindest attention.
His name is well known to you, as that of a man who has, perhaps,
deserved more than any other individual at the hands of every
student of marine Botany. His treatises upon the <i>Classification
of the Submersed Alg&aelig;</i>, have been honored with admission
in the <i>M&eacute;moires du Mus&eacute;um d'Histoire
Naturelle</i>, and have procured him the distinction of being
elected into the National Institute: his subsequent publication on
the <i>Corallines</i>, is an admirable <a name="Page_217"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;217]</span></a>manual, in a very
difficult branch of natural history; and he is now preparing for
the press, a work of still greater labor and more extensive
utility, an arrangement of the organized fossils found in the
vicinity of Caen.</p>

<p>The whole of this neighborhood abounds in remains of the
antediluvian world: they are found not only in considerable
quantity, but in great perfection. In the course of last year; a
fossil crocodile was dug up at Allemagne, a village about a mile
distant, imbedded in blue lias. Other specimens of the same genus,
comprising, as it appears, two species, both of them distinct from
any that are known in a living state, had previously been
discovered in a bed of similar hard blue limestone, near Havre and
Honfleur, as well as upon the opposite shores of England. But the
Caen specimen is the most interesting of any, as the first that has
been seen with its scales perfect; and the naturalists here have
availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them, to
determine it by a specific character, and give it the name of
<i>Crocodilus Cadomensis</i>.</p>

<p>The civil and ecclesiastical history of Caen will be amply
illustrated in the forthcoming volumes of the Abb&eacute; de la
Rue, as he is preparing a work on the subject, <i>&agrave;
l'instar</i> of the Essays of St. Foix. In the leading events of
the duchy, we find the town of Caen had but little share. It is
only upon the occasion of two sieges from our countrymen, the one
in 1346, the other in 1417, that it appears to have acted a
prominent part. The details of the first siege are given at some
length by Froissart.--Edward IIIrd, accompanied by the Black
Prince, had landed at La Hogue; and, meeting with no effectual
resistance, had pillaged the towns of Barfleur, <a name="Page_218"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;218]</span></a>Cherbourg, Carentan, and St.
L&ocirc;, after which he led his army hither. Caen, as Froissait
tells us, was at that time "large, strong, and full of drapery and
all other sorts of merchandize, rich citizens, noble dames and
damsels, and fine churches." In its defence were assembled the
Constable of France, with the Counts of Eu, Guignes, and
Tancarville. But the wisdom of the generals was defeated by the
impetuosity of the citizens. They saw themselves equal in number to
the invaders, and, without reflecting how little numerical
superiority avails in war against experience and tactics, they
required to be led against the foe. They were so, and were
defeated. The conquerors and conquered entered the city pell-mell;
and Edward, enraged at the citizens for shooting upon his troops
from the windows, issued orders that the inhabitants should be put
to the sword, and the town burned. The mandate, however, was not
executed: Sir Godfrey de Harcourt, with wise remonstrances,
assuaged the anger of the sovereign, and diverted him from his
purpose.--Immense were the riches taken on the occasion. The
English fleet returned home loaded with cloth, and jewels, and
gold, and silver plate, together with sixty knights, and upwards of
three hundred able men, prisoners. This gallant exploit was shortly
afterwards followed by the decisive battle of Cr&eacute;cy.</p>

<p>Caen suffered still more severely upon the occasion of its
second capture; when Henry IVth marched upon the town immediately
after landing at Touques. The siege was longer, and the place,
taken by assault, was given up to indiscriminate plunder. Even the
churches were not spared: that of the Holy Sepulchre was
demolished, <a name="Page_219"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;219]</span></a>and, among its other treasures,
a crucifix was carried away, containing a portion of the real
cross, which, as we are told, testified by so many miracles its
displeasure at being taken to England, that the conquerors were
glad to restore it to its original destination.</p>

<p>From this time to the year 1450, our countrymen kept undisturbed
possession of Caen. In the latter year they capitulated to the
Count de Dunois, after a gallant resistance. But though the town
has thenceforward remained, without interruption, subject to the
crown of France, it has not therefore been always free from the
miseries of warfare. A dreadful riot took place here in 1512,
occasioned by the disorderly conduct of a body of six thousand
German mercenaries, whom Louis XIIth introduced, by way of
garrison, to guard against any sudden attack from Henry VIIIth. The
character given by De Bourgueville of these <i>Lansquenets</i> is,
that they were "drunkards who guzzle wine, cider, and beer, out of
earthen pots, and then fall asleep upon the table." Three hundred
lives were lost upon this occasion, on the part of the Germans
alone.--In the middle of the same century, happened the civil
wars, originating in the reformation: and in the course of these,
Caen suffered dreadfully from the contending parties. Friend and
foe conspired alike to its ruin: what was saved from the violence
of the Huguenots, was taken by the treachery of the Catholics,
under the plausible pretext of its being placed in security. Thus,
after the Calvinists had already seized on every thing precious
that fell in their way, the Duke de Bouillon, the governor of the
town, commanded all the reliquaries, shrines, church-plate, and
ecclesiastical <a name="Page_220"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;220]</span></a>ornaments, to be carried to him
at the castle; and he had no sooner got them into his possession,
than "all holy, rich, and precious, as they were, he caused them to
be melted down, and converted into coin to pay his soldiers; and he
scattered the relics, so that they have never been seen
more."--Loosen but the bands of society, and you will find
that, in all ages of the world, the case has been nearly the same;
and, as upon the banks of the Simoeis, so upon the plains of
Normandy,--</p>

<h4>VIEUX--LA MALADERIE--CHESNUT TIMBER--CAEN
STONE--HISTORY OF BAYEUX--TAPESTRY.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Bayeux, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Letters just received from England oblige us to change our
course entirely: their contents are of such a nature, that we could
not prolong our journey with comfort or satisfaction. We must
return to England; and, instead of regretting the objects which we
have lost, we must rejoice that we have seen so much, and
especially that we have been able to visit the cathedral and
tapestry of Bayeux.</p>

<p>At the same time, I will not deny that we certainly could have
wished to have explored the vicinity of Caen, where an ample
harvest of subjects, both for the pen and pencil, is to be
gathered; but the circumstances that control us would not even
allow of a pilgrimage to the shrine of our Lady of la
D&eacute;livrande, on the border of the English Channel, or of an
excursion to the village of Vieux, in the opposite
direction.--Antiquaries have been divided in opinion,
concerning the nature and character of the buildings which
anciently occupied the site of this village.--The remains of a
Roman aqueduct are still to be seen there, and the foundations of
ancient edifices are distinctly to be traced. In the course of the
last century, a gymnasium was likewise discovered, of great size,
constructed according to the rules laid down by Vitruvius, and a
hypocaust, connected with a fine stone basin, twelve feet in
diameter, surrounded by three rows of <a name="Page_222"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;222]</span></a>seats. Abundance of
medals of the upper empire, among others, of Crispina, wife to
Commodus, and Latin inscriptions and sarcophagi, are frequently dug
up among its ruins<a name="FNanchor82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>. Hence, a belief has commonly
prevailed that during the Roman dominion in Gaul, Vieux was a city,
and that Caen, which is only six miles distant, arose from its
ruins. This opinion was strenuously combated by Huet; yet it
subsequently found a new advocate in the Abb&eacute; Le Beuf<a
name="FNanchor83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>.
The bishop contends that the extent of the buildings rather denotes
the ruins of a fortified camp, than of a city; and he therefore
considers it most probable, that Vieux was the site of an
encampment, raised near the Orne, for the purpose of defending the
passage of the river, at the point where it was crossed by the
military road that led from the district of the <a name="Page_223"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;223]</span></a>Bessin,
to that of the Hiesmois.--Portions of the causeway, may still
be traced, constructed of the same kind of brick as the aqueduct;
and the name of the village so far tends to corroborate the
conjecture, that <i>Vieux</i> originally denoted a ford; and the
word <i>V&eacute;</i>, which is most probably a corruption from it,
retains this signification in Norman French.--The Abb&eacute;,
at the same time that he does not pretend to contradict the
argument deduced from etymology, maintains that a careful
comparison of the position of Vieux, with the distances marked on
the <i>Tabula Peutingeriana</i>, and with what Ptolemy relates of
certain towns adjoining the Viducassian territory, will support him
in the assertion, that Vieux was the ancient <i>Augustodurum</i>
the Viducassian capital; and that Bayeux was probably the site of
<i>Arigenus</i> another of the towns of that tribe.--The red,
veined marble of Vieux is much esteemed in France; as are also the
other marbles of this department, which vary in color from a dull
white, through grey, to blue. The quarries, as is generally
believed, were first opened and worked by the Romans. Vieux marble
is to be seen at Paris, where it was employed by Cardinal
Richelieu, in the construction of the chapel of the Sorbonne.</p>

<p>At about a mile from Caen, on the road to Bayeux, stands the
village of St. Germain de Blancherbe, more commonly called in the
neighborhood <i>la Maladerie</i>, a name derived from the
lazar-house in it, the <i>L&eacute;proserie de Beaulieu</i>,
founded by Henry IInd, in 1161.--Robert Du Mont terms the
building a wonderful work. It was a princely establishment,
designed for the reception of lepers from all the parishes of Caen,
except four, <a name="Page_224"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;224]</span></a>whose patients had an especial
right to be admitted into a smaller hospital in the same place. The
great hospital is now used as a house of correction. Seen from the
road, it appears to be principally of modern architecture though
still retaining a portion of the ancient structure; the same,
probably, as is mentioned by Ducarel, who says, that "part of the
magnificent chapel, which was considered as the parish church for
the lepers, and ruined by the English, is turned into a large
common hall for the prisoners, and separated from the other part,
which is made into a chapel, by means of an iron gate, through
which they may have an opportunity of hearing mass celebrated every
morning."--Within the village street stands a desecrated
church of the earliest Norman style, with a very perfect door-way.
The present parish church, though chiefly modern, deserves
attention on account of the west front, which is wholly of the
semi-circular style, and is somewhat curious, from having two
Norman buttresses, that rise from a string-course at the top of the
basement story, (in which the arched door-way is contained,) and
are thence continued upwards till they unite with the roof. The
decorations round its southern entrance are also remarkable: they
principally consist of a very sharp chevron moulding, interspersed
with foliage and various figures.</p>

<p>The quarries in this village, and in that of Allemagne, on the
opposite side of the Orne, supply most of the free-stone, for which
Caen has, during many centuries, been celebrated. Stone of the
finest quality is found in strata of different thickness, at the
depth of about sixty feet below the surface of the ground. If
worked <a name="Page_225"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;225]</span></a>much lower, it ceases to be
good. It is brought up in square blocks, about nine feet wide, and
two feet thick, by means of vertical wheels, placed at the mouths
of the pits. When first dug from the quarry, its color is a pure
and glossy white, and its texture very soft; but as it hardens it
takes a browner hue, and loses its lustre.</p>

<p>In former days this stone was exported in great quantity to our
own country. Stow, in his <i>Survey of London</i>, states that
London Bridge, Westminster Abbey, and several others of our public
edifices were built with it. Extracts from sundry charters relative
to the quarries are quoted by Ducarel, who adds that, in his time,
though many cargoes of the stone were annually conveyed by water to
the different provinces of the kingdom, the exportation of it out
of France was strictly prohibited, insomuch that, when it was to be
sent by sea, the owner of the stone, as well as the master of the
vessel on board of which it was shipped, was obliged to give
security that it should not be sold to foreigners.--We omitted
to inquire how far the same prohibitions still continue in
force.</p>

<p>At but a short distance from St. Germain de Blancherbe, stands
the ruined abbey of Ardennes, now the residence of a farmer; but
still preserving the features of a monastic building. The convent
was founded in 1138, for canons of the Pr&aelig;monstratensian
order. Its Celtic name denotes its antiquity, as it also tends to
prove that this part of the country was covered with timber. The
word, <i>arden</i>, signified a forest, and was thence applied,
with a slight variation in orthography, to the largest forest in
England, and to the more celebrated forest in the vicinity <a name="Page_226"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;226]</span></a>of
Liege. According to tradition, the Norman ardennes consisted: of
chesnut-trees. De Bourgueville tells us that timber of this
description is the principal material of most of the houses in the
town. John Evelyn relates the same of those in London; and in our
own counties wherever a village church has been so fortunate as to
preserve its ancient timber cieling, the clerk is almost sure to
state that the wood is chesnut. Either this tree therefore must
formerly have abounded in places where it has now almost ceased to
exist, or oak timber must have been commonly mistaken for it: and
we may equally adopt both these conjectures. The yew and the
service, as well as the chesnut, are occasionally mentioned in old
charters, and are admitted by botanists to be indigenous in
England. I should doubt, however, if any one of them could now be
found in a wild state; and there is a fashion in planting as well
as in every thing else, which renders peculiar trees more or less
abundant at different times.</p>

<p>About half way between Caen and Bayeux, is the village of
Bretteville l'Orgueilleuse, the lofty tower of whose church,
perforated with long lancet windows, and surmounted by a high
spire, excites curiosity. Churches are numerous in this
neighborhood, and there is no other part of Normandy, in which,
architecturally considered, they are equally deserving of notice.
Scarcely one is to be seen that is not marked by some peculiarity.
I know not why Bretteville acquired the epithet attached to its
name; and I am equally at a loss for the derivation of the word
<i>Bretteville</i> itself; but the term must have <a name="Page_227"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;227]</span></a>some
signification in Normandy, at least eleven villages in the duchy
being so called.</p>

<p>The first part of the road to Bayeux passes through a flat and
open district, resembling that on the other side of Caen; in the
remaining half, the country is enclosed, with a more varied
surface. Apple-trees again abound; and the old custom of suspending
a bush over the door of an inn is commonly practised here. For this
purpose misletoe is almost always selected. Throughout the whole of
this district and the neighboring province of Brittany, the ancient
attachment of the Druids to misletoe continues to a certain degree
to prevail. The commencement of the new year is hailed by shouts of
"au gui; l'an neuf;" and the gathering of the misletoe for the
occasion is still the pretext for a merry-making, if not for a
religious ceremony.</p>

<p>Bayeux was the seat of an academy of the Druids. Ausonius
expressly addresses Attius Patera Pather, one of the professors at
Bordeaux, as being of the family of the priesthood of this
district:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Doctor potentum rhetorum,</p>

<p>Tu Bajocassis stirpe Druidarum satus;"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And tradition to this hour preserves the remembrance of the spot
that was hallowed by the celebration of their mystic rites. This
spot, an eminence adjoining the city, has subsequently served for
the site of a priory dedicated to St. Nicholas <i>de la
chesnaye</i>, thus commemorating by the epithet, the oaks that
formed the holy grove. Near it stood the famous temple of Mount
Phaunus, which <a name="Page_228"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;228]</span></a>was flourishing in the
beginning of the fourth century, and, according to Rivet, was
considered one of the three most celebrated in Gaul. Belenus was
the divinity principally worshipped in it; but, according to
popular superstition, adoration was also paid to a golden calf,
which was buried in the hill, and still remains entombed there.
Even within the last fifty years, two laborers have lost their
lives in a fruitless attempt to find this hidden treasure. Tombs,
and urns, and human bones, are constantly discovered; yet neither
Druidic temples, nor pillars of stone, nor cromlechs or Celtic
remains of any description exist, at least, at present, in the
neighborhood of Bayeux.</p>

<p>Roman relics, however, abound. The vases and statues dug up near
this city, have afforded employment to the pen and the pencil of
Count Caylus, who, judging from the style of art, refers the
greater part of them to the times of Julius and Augustus
C&aelig;sar. Medals of the earliest emperors have likewise
frequently been detected among the foundations of the houses of the
city; and even so recently as in the beginning of the present
century, mutilated cippi, covered with Latin inscriptions, have
been brought to light. These discoveries all tend to shew the Roman
origin of Bayeux, and two Roman causeways also join here; so that,
notwithstanding the arguments of the Abb&eacute; le Beuf, most
antiquaries still believe that Bayeux was the city called by
Ptolemy the <i>N&aelig;omagus Viducassium</i>.--The term
<i>Viducasses</i> or <i>Biducasses</i> was in early ages changed to
<i>Bajocasses</i>; and the city, following the custom that
prevailed in Gaul, took the appellation of <i>Bajoc&aelig;</i>, or,
as <a name="Page_229"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;229]</span></a>it was occasionally written, of
<i>Bai&aelig;</i> or <i>Bagic&aelig;</i>. Its name in French has
likewise been subject to alterations.--During the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, it was <i>Baex</i> and <i>Bajeves</i>; in the
fourteenth <i>Bajex</i>; in the sixteenth <i>Baieux</i>; and soon
afterwards it settled info the present orthography.</p>

<p>Pursuing the history of Bayeux somewhat farther, we find this
city in the <i>Notitia Galile&aelig;</i> holding the first rank
among the towns of the <i>Secunda Lugdunensis</i>. During the
Merovingian and Carlovingian dynasties, its importance is proved by
the mint which was established here. Golden coins, struck under the
first race of French sovereigns, inscribed <i>HBAJOCAS</i>, and
silver pieces, coined by Charles the Bald, with the legend
<i>HBAJOCAS-CIVITAS</i>, are mentioned by Le Blanc. Bayeux was also
in those times, one of the head-quarters of the high functionaries,
entitled <i>Missi Dominici</i>, who were annually deputed by the
monarchy for the promulgation of their decrees and the
administration of justice. Two other cities only in Neustria, Rouen
and Lisieux, were distinguished with the same privilege.--Nor
did Bayeux suffer any diminution of its honors, under the Norman
Dukes: they regarded it as the second town of the duchy, and had a
palace here, and frequently made it the seat of their <i>Aula
Regio</i>.</p>

<p>The destruction of the Roman Bayeux is commonly ascribed, like
that of the Roman Lisieux, to the Saxon invasion. No traces of the
Viducassian capital are to be found in history, subsequently to the
reign of Constantine; no medals, no inscriptions of a later period,
have been dug up within its precincts. During the earliest
incursions <a name="Page_230"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;230]</span></a>of the Saxons in Gaul, they
seem to have made this immediate neighborhood the seat of a
permanent settlement. The Abb&eacute; Le Beuf places the district,
known by the name of the <i>Otlingua Saxonia</i>, between Bayeux
and Isigny; and Gregory of Tours, in his relation of the events
that occurred towards the close of the sixth century, makes
repeated mention of the <i>Saxones Bajocassini</i>, whom the early
Norman historians style <i>Saisnes de Bayeux</i>. Under the reign
of Charlemagne, a fresh establishment of Saxons took place here.
That emperor, after the bloody defeat of this valiant people, about
the year 804, caused ten thousand men, with their wives and
children, to be delivered up to him as prisoners, and dispersed
them in different parts of France. Some of the captives were
colonized in Neustria; and, among the rest, Witikind, son of the
brave chief of the same name, who had fought so nobly in defence of
the liberty of his country, had lands assigned to him in the
Bessin. Hence, names of Saxon origin commonly occur throughout the
diocese of Bayeux; sometimes alone and undisguised, but more
frequently in composition. Thus, in <i>Estelan</i>, you will have
little difficulty in recognizing <i>East-land: Cape la Hogue</i>
will readily suggest the idea of a lofty promontory; its
appellation being derived from the German adjective, <i>hoch</i>,
still written <i>hoog</i>, in Flemish: the Saxon word for the
Almighty enters into the family names of <i>Argot</i>,
<i>Turgot</i>, <i>Bagot</i>, <i>Bigot</i>, &amp;c.; and, not to
multiply examples, the quaking sands upon the sea-shore are to the
present hour called <i>bougues</i>, an evident corruption of our
own word <i>bogs</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Page_231"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;231]</span></a></p>
<p>When, towards the middle of the same century, the Saxons were
succeeded by the Normans, the country about Bayeux was one of the
districts that suffered most from the new invaders. Two bishops of
the see, Sulpitius and Baltfridus, were murdered by the barbarians;
and Bayeux itself was pillaged and burned, notwithstanding the
valiant resistance made by the governor, Berenger. This nobleman,
who was count of the Bessin, was personally obnoxious to Rollo, for
having refused him his daughter, the beautiful Poppea, in marriage.
But, on the capture of the town, Poppea was taken prisoner, and
compelled to share the conqueror's bed. Bayeux arose from its ruins
under the auspices of Botho, a Norman chieftain, to whom Rollo was
greatly attached, and who succeeded to the honors of Berenger. By
him the town was rebuilt, and filled with a Norman population, the
consequence of which was, according to Dudo of St. Quintin, that
William Longa-Spatha, the successor of Rollo, who hated the French
language, sent his son, Duke Richard, to be educated at Bayeux,
where Danish alone was spoken. And the example of the Duke
continued for some time to be imitated by his successors upon the
throne; so that Bayeux became the academy for the children of the
royal family, till they arrived at a sufficient age to be removed
to the metropolis, there to be instructed in the art of
government.</p>

<p>The dignity of Count of the Bessin ceased in the reign of
William the Conqueror, in consequence of a rebellion on the part of
the barons, which had well nigh cost that sovereign his life. From
that time, till the conquest of Normandy by the French, the
nobleman, who presided over the Bessin, bore the title of the
king's viscount; <a name="Page_232"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;232]</span></a>and, under this name, you will
find him the first cited among the four viscounts of Lower
Normandy, in the famous parliament of all the barons of this part
of the duchy, convened at Caen by Henry IInd, in 1152.--When
Philip Augustus gained possession of Normandy, all similar
appointments were re-modelled, and viscounts placed in every town;
but their power was restricted to the mere administration of
justice, the rest of their privileges being transferred to a new
description of officers, who were then created, with the name of
bailiffs. The bailiwicks assigned to these bore no reference to the
ancient divisions of the duchy; but the territorial partition made
at that time, has ever since been preserved, and Caen, which was
honored by Philip with a preference over Bayeux, continues to the
present day to retain the pre-eminence.</p>

<p>After these troubles, Bayeux enjoyed a temporary tranquillity;
and, according to the celebrated historical tapestry and to the
<i>Roman de Rou</i>, this city was selected for the place at which
William the Conqueror, upon being nominated by Edward, as his
successor to the crown of England, caused Harold to attend, and to
do homage to him in the name of the nation. The oath was taken upon
a missal covered with cloth of gold, in the presence of the
prelates and grandees of the duchy; and the reliques of the saints
were collected from all quarters to bear witness to the ceremony.
Bayeux was also the spot in which Henry Ist was detained prisoner
by his eldest brother, and it suffered for this unfortunate
distinction; for Henry had scarcely ascended the <a name="Page_233"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;233]</span></a>English
throne, when, upon a shallow pretext, he advanced against the city,
laid siege to it, and burned it to the ground; whether moved to
this act of vengeance from hatred towards the seat of his
sufferings, or to satisfy the foreigners in his pay, whom the
length of the siege had much irritated. He had promised these men
the pillage of the city, and he kept his word; but the soldiers
were not content with the plunder: they set fire to the town, and
what had escaped their ravages, perished in the flames.<a name="FNanchor84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> In
1356, under the reign of Edward IIIrd, Bayeux experienced nearly
the same fate from our countrymen; and in the following century it
again suffered severely from their arms, till the decisive battle
of Formigny, fought within ten miles of the city, compelled Henry
VIth to withdraw from Normandy, carrying with him scarcely any
other trophies of his former conquests, than a great collection of
Norman charters, and, among the rest, those of Bayeux, which are to
this hour preserved in the tower of London.</p>

<p>During the subsequent wars occasioned by the reformation, this
town bore its share in the common sufferings of the north of
France. The horrors experienced by other places on the occasion
were even surpassed by the outrages that were committed at Bayeux;
but it is impossible to enter into details which are equally
revolting to decency and to humanity.</p>

<p>Of late years, Bayeux has been altogether an open town. The old
castle, the last relic of its military character, a spacious
fortress flanked by ten square towers, <a name="Page_234"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;234]</span></a>was demolished in 1773;
and, as the poet of Bayeux has sung<a name="FNanchor85"></a><a
href="#Footnote_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>,--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"... Gaulois, Romains, Saxons,</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>And in truth, they are so effectually <i>effaced</i>, that not a
single vestige of the walls and towers can now be discovered.</p>

<p>Bayeux is situated in the midst of a fertile country,
particularly rich in pasturage. The Aure, which washes its walls,
is a small and insignificant streamlet, and though the city is
within five miles of the sea, yet the river is quite useless for
the purposes of commerce, as not a vessel can float in it. The
present population of the town consists of about ten thousand
inhabitants, and these have little other employment than
lace-making.--Bayeux wears the appearance of decay: most of
the houses are ordinary; and, though some of them are built of
stone, by far the greater part are only of wood and plaster. In the
midst, however, of these, rises the noble cathedral; but this I
shall reserve for the subject of my next letter, concluding the
present with a few remarks upon that matchless relic, which,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"... des si&egrave;cles respect&eacute;,</p>

<p>&nbsp;En peignant des h&eacute;ros honore la beaut&eacute;."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The very curious piece of historical needle-work, now generally
known by the name of the <i>Bayeux tapestry</i>, <a name="Page_235"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;235]</span></a>was
first brought into public notice in the early part of the last
century, by Father Montfaucon and M. Lancelot, both of whom, in
their respective publications, the <i>Monumens de la Monarchie
Fran&ccedil;aise</i><a name="FNanchor86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>, and a paper inserted in the
<i>M&eacute;moires de l'Acad&eacute;mie des Inscriptions</i><a
name="FNanchor87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>,
have figured and described this celebrated specimen of ancient art.
Montfaucon's plates were afterwards republished by Ducarel<a name="FNanchor88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>, with
the addition of a short dissertation and explanation, by an able
antiquary of our own country, Smart Lethieuilier.</p>

<p>These plates, however, in the original, and still more in the
copies, were miserably incorrect, and calculated not to inform, but
to mislead the inquirer. When therefore the late war was concluded
and France became again accessible to an Englishman, our Society of
Antiquaries, justly considering the tapestry as being at least
equally connected with English as with French history, and
regarding it as a matter of national importance, that so curious a
document should be made known by the most faithful representation,
employed an artist, fitted above all others for the purpose, by his
knowledge of history and his abilities as a draughtsman, to prepare
an exact fac-simile of the whole. Under the auspices of the
Society, Mr. C.A. Stothard undertook the task; and he has executed
it in the course of two successive visits with the greatest
accuracy and skill. The engravings from his drawings we may hope
shortly to see: meanwhile, to give you some idea of the original, I
enclose <a name="Page_236"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;236]</span></a>a sketch, which has no other
merit than that of being a faithful transcript. It is reduced one
half from a tracing made from the tapestry itself. By referring to
Montfaucon, you will find the figure it represents under the
fifty-ninth inscription in the original, where "a knight, with a
<i>private</i> banner, issues to mount a led horse." His beardless
countenance denotes him a Norman; and the mail covering to his legs
equally proves him to be one of the most distinguished
characters.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_45"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_45.png" height="480" width="285" alt="Figure from the Bayeux Tapestry" /></p>

<p>Within the few last years this tapestry has been the subject of
three interesting papers, read before the Society of Antiquaries.
The first and most important, from the pen of the Abb&eacute; de la
Rue<a name="FNanchor89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>, has for its object the
refutation of the opinions of Montfaucon and Lancelot, who,
following the commonly received tradition, refer the tapestry to
the time of the conquest, and represent it as the work of Queen
Matilda and her attendant damsels. The Abb&eacute;'s principal
arguments are derived from the silence of contemporary authors, and
especially of Wace, who was himself a canon of Bayeux;--from
its being unnoticed in any charters or deeds of gift connected with
the cathedral;--from the improbability that so large a roll of
such perishable materials would have escaped destruction when the
cathedral was burned in 1106;--from the unfinished state of
the story;--from its containing some Saxon names unknown to
the Normans;--and from representations taken from the fables
of &AElig;sop being worked on the borders, whereas the northern
parts of Europe were not made acquainted with these fables, till
the translation of a portion of them by Henry Ist, who thence
obtained his <a name="Page_237"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;237]</span></a>surname of
<i>Beauclerk</i>.--These and other considerations, have led
the learned Abb&eacute; to coincide in opinion with Lord Littleton
and Mr. Hume, that the tapestry is the production of the Empress
Maud, and that it was in reality wrought by natives of our own
island, whose inhabitants were at that time so famous for labors of
this description, that the common mode of expressing a piece of
embroidery, was by calling it <i>an English work</i>.</p>

<p>The Abb&eacute; shortly afterwards found an opponent in another
member of the society, Mr. Hudson Gurney, who, without following
his predecessor through the line of his arguments, contented
himself with briefly stating the three following reasons for
ascribing the tapestry to Matilda, wife to the Conqueror<a name="FNanchor90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>.--<i>First</i>, that in the
many buildings therein pourtrayed, there is not the least
appearance of a pointed arch, though much pointed work is found in
the ornaments of the running border; whilst, on the contrary, the
features of Norman architecture, the square buttress, flat to the
walls, and the square tower surmounted by, or rather ending in, a
low pinnacle, are therein frequently
repeated.--<i>Secondly</i>, that all the knights are in ring
armour, many of their shields charged with a species of cross and
five dots, and some with dragons, but none with any thing of the
nature of armorial bearings, which, in a lower age, there would
have been; and that all wear a triangular sort of conical helmet,
with a nasal, when represented armed.--And, <i>Thirdly</i>,
that the Norman banner is, invariably, <i>Argent</i>, a Cross,
<i>Or</i>, in a Bordure <i>Azure</i>; and that this is repeated
over and over again, as it is in the war against Conan, as <a name="Page_238"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;238]</span></a>well as
at Pevensey and at Hastings; but there is neither hint nor trace of
the later invention of the Norman leopards.--Mr. Gurney's
arguments are ingenious, but they are not, I fear, likely to be
considered conclusive: he however, has been particularly successful
in another observation, that all writers, who had previously
treated of the Bayeux tapestry, had called it a <i>Monument of the
Conquest of England</i>; following, therein, M. Lancelot, and
speaking of it as an unfinished work, whereas, it is in fact an
<i>apologetical history of the claims of William to the crown of
England, and of the breach of faith and fall of Harold</i>, in a
perfect and finished action.--With this explanation before us,
aided by the short indication that is given of the subjects of the
seventy-two compartments of the tapestry, a new light is thrown
upon the story.</p>

<p>The third memoir is from the pen of Mr. Amyot, and concludes
with an able metrical translation from Wace. It is confined almost
exclusively to the discussion of the single historical fact, how
far Harold was really sent by the Confessor to offer the succession
to William; but this point, however interesting, in itself, is
unconnected with my present object: it is sufficient for me to shew
you the various sources from which you may derive information upon
the subject.</p>

<p>Supposing the Bayeux tapestry to be really from the hands of the
Queen, or the Empress, (and that it was so appears to me proved by
internal evidence,) it is rather extraordinary that the earliest
notice which is to be found of a piece of workmanship, so
interesting from its author and its subjects, should be contained
in an <a name="Page_239"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;239]</span></a>inventory of the precious
effects deposited in the treasury of the church, dated 1476. It is
also remarkable that this inventory, in mentioning such an article,
should call it simply <i>a very long piece of cloth, embroidered
with figures and writing, representing the conquest of England</i>,
without any reference to the royal artist or the donor.</p>

<p>Observations of this nature will suggest themselves to every
one, and the arguments urged by the Abb&eacute; de la Rue are very
strong; and yet I confess that my own feelings always inclined to
the side of those who assign the highest antiquity to the tapestry.
I think so the more since I have seen it. No one appears so likely
to have undertaken such a task as the female most nearly connected
with the principal personage concerned in it, and especially if we
consider what the character of this female was: the details which
it contains are so minute, that they could scarcely have been
known, except at the time when they took place: the letters agree
in form with those upon Matilda's tomb; and the manners and customs
of the age are also preserved.--Mr. Stothard, who is of the
same opinion as to the date of the tapestry, very justly observes,
that the last of these circumstances can scarcely be sufficiently
insisted upon; for that "it was the invariable practice with
artists in every country, excepting Italy, during the middle ages,
whatever subject they took in hand, to represent it according to
the costume of their own times."</p>

<p>Till the revolution, the tapestry was always kept in the
cathedral, in a chapel on the south side, dedicated to Thomas
&agrave; Becket, and was only exposed to public view <a name="Page_240"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;240]</span></a>once a
year, during the octave of the feast of St. John on which occasion
it was hung up in the nave of the church, which it completely
surrounded. From the time thus selected for the display of it, the
tapestry acquired the name of <i>le toile de Saint Jean</i>; and it
is to the present day commonly so called in the city. During the
most stormy part of the revolution, it was secreted; but it was
brought to Paris when the fury of vandalism had subsided. And, when
the first Consul was preparing for the invasion of England, this
ancient trophy of the subjugation of the British nation was proudly
exhibited to the gaze of the Parisians, who saw another
<i>Conqueror</i> in Napol&eacute;on Bonapart&eacute;; and many
well-sounding effusions, in prose and verse, appeared, in which the
laurels of Duke William were transferred, by anticipation, to the
brows of the child and champion of jacobinism. After this display,
Bonapart&eacute; returned the tapestry to the municipality,
accompanied by a letter, in which he thanked them for the care they
had taken of so precious a relic. From that period to the present,
it has remained in the residence appropriated to the mayor, the
former episcopal palace; and here we saw it.</p>

<p>It is a piece of brownish linen cloth, about two hundred and
twelve feet long, and eighteen inches wide, French measure. The
figures are worked with worsted of different colors, but
principally light red, blue, and yellow. The historical series is
included between borders composed of animals, &amp;c. The colors
are faded, but not so much so as might have been expected. The
figures exhibit a regular line of events, commencing with Edward
the Confessor seated upon his throne, in the act of dispatching <a
name="Page_241"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;241]</span></a>Harold to the court of the
Norman Duke, and continued through Harold's journey, his capture by
the Comte de Ponthieu, his interview with William, the death of
Edward, the usurpation of the British throne by Harold, the Norman
invasion, the battle of Hastings, and Harold's death. These various
events are distributed into seventy-two compartments, each of them
designated by an inscription in Latin. Ducarel justly compares the
style of the execution to that of a girl's sampler. The figures are
covered with work, except on their faces, which are merely in
outline. In point of drawing, they are superior to the contemporary
sculpture at St. Georges and elsewhere; and the performance is not
deficient in energy. The colors are distributed rather fancifully:
thus the fore and off legs of the horses are varied. It is hardly
necessary to observe that perspective is wholly disregarded, and
that no attempt is made to express light and shadow.</p>

<p>Great attention, however, is paid to costume; and more
individuality of character has been preserved than could have been
expected, considering the rude style of the workmanship. The Saxons
are represented with long mustachios: the Normans have their upper
lip shaven, and retain little more hair upon their heads than a
single lock in front.--Historians relate how the English spies
reported the invading army to be wholly composed of ecclesiastics;
and this tapestry affords a graphical illustration of the
chroniclers' text. Not the least remarkable feature of the
tapestry, in point of costume, lies in the armor, which, in some
instances, is formed of interlaced rings; in others, of square
compartments; and in others, of lozenges. Those who contend for the
antiquity of <a name="Page_242"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;242]</span></a>Duke William's equestrian
statue at Caen, may find a confirmation of their opinions in the
shape of the saddles assigned to the figures of the Bayeux
tapestry; and equally so in their cloaks, and their pendant braided
tresses.</p>

<p>The tapestry is coiled round a cylinder, which is turned by a
winch and wheel; and it is rolled and unrolled with so little
attention, that if it continues under such management as the
present, it will be wholly ruined in the course of half a century.
It is injured at the beginning: towards the end it becomes very
ragged, and several of the figures have completely disappeared. The
worsted is unravelling too in many of the intermediate portions. As
yet, however, it is still in good preservation, considering its
great age, though, as I have just observed, it will not long
continue so. The bishop and chapter have lately applied to
government, requesting that the tapestry may be restored to the
church. I hope their application will be successful.</p>

most interesting relic of Roman times yet found at Vieux, is a
cippus of variegated marble, about five feet high by two feet wide,
and bearing inscriptions upon three of its sides. It generally
passes in France by the name of the <i>Torigny marble</i>, being
preserved at the small town of the latter name, whither it was
carried in 1580, the very year when it was dug up. The Abb&eacute;
Le Beuf has made it the subject of a distinct paper in the

cippus supported a statue raised in honor of Titus Sennius
Sollemnis, a Viducassian by birth, and one of the high priests of
the town. The statue was erected to him after his death, in the
Viducassian capital, upon a piece of ground granted by the senate
for the purpose, in pursuance of a general decree passed by the
province of Gaul. The inscriptions set forth the motives that
induced the nation to bestow so marked a distinction upon a simple
individual; and, in the foremost rank of his merits, they place the
games which he had given to his fellow-citizens, during four
successive days.</p>

<h4>CATHEDRAL OF BAYEUX--CANON OF CAMBREMER--COPE OF ST.
REGNOBERT--ODO.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Bayeux, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Excepting the tapestry and the cathedral, Bayeux, at this time,
offers no objects of interest to the curious traveller. Its
convents are either demolished, or so dilapidated or altered, that
they have lost their characteristic features; and its eighteen
parish churches are now reduced to four. We wandered awhile about
the town, vainly looking after some relic of ancient art, to send
you by way of a memento of Bayeux. At length, two presented
themselves--the entrance of the corn-market, formerly the
chapel of St. Margaret, a Norman arch, remarkable for the lamb and
banner, an emblem of the saint, sculptured on the transom stone;
and a small stone tablet, attached to an old house near the
cathedral. The whimsical singularity of the latter, induced us to
give it the preference. It may possibly be of the workmanship of
the fourteenth century, and possibly much later. In all
probability, it owes its existence merely to a caprice on the part
of the owner of the residence, whose crest may be indicated by the
tortoises which surmount the columns by way of capitals. Still
there is merit in the performance, though perhaps for nothing so
much as for the accurate resemblance of peeled wood; and this I
never saw imitated with equal fidelity in stone.</p>

<p>But, however unattractive Bayeux may be in other respects, so
long as the cathedral is suffered to stand, <a name="Page_244"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;244]</span></a>the city
will never want interest. It is supposed that the first church
erected here was built by St. Exuperius otherwise called St.
Suspirius, or St. Spirius, who, according to the distich subjoined
to his portrait, formerly painted on one of the windows of the
nave, was not only the earliest bishop of the diocese, but claimed
the merit of having introduced the Christian faith into
Normandy,--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Primit&ugrave;s hic pastor templi fuit hujus et auctor,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Catholicamque fidem Normannis attulit idem."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>St. Exuperius lived in the third century, and his efforts
towards the propagation of the gospel were attended with so great
success, that his successor, St. Regnobert, was obliged to take
down the edifice thus recently raised, and to re-construct it on a
more enlarged scale, for the purpose of accommodating the
increasing congregation. Regnobert is likewise reported to have
built the celebrated chapel on the sea-coast, dedicated to our Lady
de la D&eacute;livrande; and the people believe that a portion at
least, of both the one and the other of these original edifices,
exists to the present day. The Abb&eacute; B&eacute;ziers, however,
in his <i>History of Bayeux</i>, maintains, and with truth, that
St. Regnobert's cathedral was destroyed by the Normans; and he adds
that, immediately after the conversion of Rollo, another was raised
in its stead on the same spot, and that this latter was one of
those which the chieftain most enriched by his endowments at the
period of his baptism.</p>

<p>A dreadful fire, in the year 1046, reduced the Norman cathedral
to ashes; but the episcopal throne was then filled by a prelate who
wanted neither disposition nor <a name="Page_245"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;245]</span></a>abilities to repair the damage.
Hugh, the third bishop of that name, son to Ralph, Count of the
Bessin, who, by the mother's side, was brother to Duke Richard Ist,
presided at that time over the see of Bayeux. Jealous for the honor
of his diocese, the prelate instantly applied himself to rebuild
the cathedral; but he lived to see only a small progress made in
his work. It was finished by a prelate of still greater, though
evil celebrity, the unruly Odo, brother to the Conqueror, who, for
more than fifty years, continued bishop of this see, and by his
unbounded liberality and munificence in the discharge of his high
office, proved himself worthy of his princely descent. The
Conqueror and his queen, attended by their sons, Robert and
William, and by the archbishops of Canterbury and York, as well as
by the various bishops and barons of the province, were present at
the dedication of the church, which was performed in 1077, by John,
Archbishop of Rouen. Odo, on the occasion, enriched his church with
various gifts, one of which has been particularly recorded. It was
a crown of wood and copper, sixteen feet high and thirty-eight feet
in diameter, covered with silver plates, and diversified with other
crowns in the shape of towers; the whole made to support an immense
number of tapers, that were lighted on high festivals. This crown
was suspended in the nave, opposite the great crucifix; and it
continued to hang there till it was destroyed by the Huguenots, in
1562.</p>

<p>It is doubtful how much, or indeed if any portion, of the church
erected by Odo be now in existence. Thirty years had scarcely
elapsed from the date of its dedication, <a name="Page_246"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;246]</span></a>when, as I have already
mentioned to you, the troops of Henry Ist destroyed Bayeux with
fire. The ruin was so complete, that for more than fifty years, no
attempt was made to re-construct the cathedral; but it remained in
ashes until the year 1157, when bishop, Philip of Harcourt,
determined to restore it. A question has arisen whether the oldest
part of what is now standing, be the work of Philip or of Odo. The
lapse of eighty years in those early times, would perhaps occasion
no very sensible difference in style; and chroniclers do not afford
the means of determining, if, at the time when Bayeux suffered so
dreadfully in 1106, the church was actually burned to the ground,
or only materially damaged. In the <i>History of the Diocese</i> we
are merely told that Philip, having, by means of papal bulls,
happily succeeded in regaining possession of all the privileges,
honors, and property of the see, began to rebuild his cathedral in
1159, and completed it with great glory and expence.--From
that time forward, we hear no more of demolition or of
re-edification; but the injuries done by the silent lapse of ages,
and the continued desire on the part of the prelates to beautify
and to enlarge their church, have produced nearly the same effect
as fire or warfare. The building, as it now stands, is a medley of
various ages; and, in the absence of historical record, it would be
extremely difficult to define the several portions that are to be
assigned to each.</p>

<p>The west front is flanked by two Norman towers, bold and massy,
with semi-circular arches in the highest stories. The spires
likewise appear ancient, <a name="Page_247"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;247]</span></a>though these and the
surrounding pinnacles are all gothic. The northern one, according
to tradition, was built with the church; the southern, in 1424.
They both greatly resemble those of the abbey-church of St. Stephen
at Caen. But the whole centre of this front, and indeed both the
sides also, as high as the roof, is faced by a screen divided into
five compartments. In the middle is a large, wide, pointed arch,
with a square-headed entrance beneath. North and south of this are
deep arches, evidently older, but likewise pointed, having their
sides above the pillars, and the flat arched part of the door-way,
filled with small figures. The door-ways themselves are arches that
occupy only one half of the width of those which enclose them. In
the two exterior compartments the arches are unpierced, and are
flanked by a profusion of clustered pillars. Over each of the four
lateral arches, rises a crocketed pyramid: the central one is
surmounted by a flat balustrade, above which, behind the screen, is
a large pointed window, and over it a row of saints, standing under
trefoil-headed arches, arranged in pairs, the pediment terminating
above each pair of arches in a pyramidal canopy.</p>

<p>The outside of the nave is of florid gothic, but it is not of a
pure style; nor is the southern portal, which, nevertheless,
considered as a whole, is bold and appropriate. On each side of the
door-way were originally three statues, whose tabernacles remain,
though the saints have been torn out of the niches. Over the door
is a bas-relief, containing numerous figures disposed in three
compartments, and representing some legendary tale, <a name="Page_248"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;248]</span></a>which
our knowledge of that kind of lore would not enable us to
decipher.--The exterior of the choir is likewise of pointed
architecture: it is considerably more simple, and excels, in this
respect, the rest of the church. But even here there is a great
want of uniformity: some of the windows are deeply imbedded in the
walls; others are nearly on a level with their surface.--The
cupola, which caps the low central tower, is wretchedly at variance
with the other parts of the building. It was erected in the year
1714, at the expence of the bishop, Francis de Nesmond; and it is,
as might be expected from a performance of that period, rather
Grecian than gothic. Whichever style it may be termed, it is a bad
specimen of either. And yet, such as it is, we are assured by
B&eacute;ziers, that it was built after the designs of a celebrated
architect of the name of Moussard, and that it excited particular
attention, and called forth loud praises, on the part of the
Mar&eacute;chal de Vauban, who was, probably, a better judge of a
modern fortification, than of a gothic cathedral.</p>

<p>The interior of the church consists of a wide nave, with
side-aisles, and chapels beyond them. The first six piers of the
nave are very massy, and faced with semi-circular pillars
supporting an entablature. The arches above them are Norman,
encircled with rich bands, composed chiefly of the chevron moulding
and diamonds. On one of them is a curious border of heads, as upon
the celebrated door-way at Oxford; but the heads at Bayeux are of
much more regular workmanship and more distinctly defined. Had
circumstances allowed, I <a name="Page_249"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;249]</span></a>would have sent you an accurate
drawing of them; but our time did not permit such a one to be made,
and I must beg of you to be contented with the annexed slight
sketch.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_18"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_18.png" height="187" width="310" alt="Curious border of heads" /></p>

<p>The wall above the arches is incrusted with a species of
tessellated work of free-stone, of varied patterns, some
interwoven, others reticulated, as seen in the sketches: the lines
indented in the stones, as well as the joints which form the
patterns, are filled with a black cement or mastich, so as to form
a kind of <i>niello</i>.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_19"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_19.png" height="165" width="279" alt="Joints which form the pattern" /></p>

<p>With the sixth arch of the nave begins the pointed style. The
capitals of the pillars are complicated, and the <a name="Page_250"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;250]</span></a>carving
upon them is an evident attempt at an imitation of the Grecian
orders. In this part of the church there is no triforium; but a row
of small quartrefoils runs immediately above the ornaments of the
spandrils; and above the quatrefoils is a cornice of an antique
pattern, which is surmounted by a light gallery in front of the
windows of the clerestory, the largest windows I remember to have
seen in a similar situation. They extend almost from the roof to
the line of the old Norman basement. Their magnitude is rendered
still more remarkable by their being arranged in pairs, each
separate pair inclosed within a pointed arch, and its windows
parted only by a clustered pillar. The very lofty arches that
support the central tower, are likewise pointed; as are those of
the transepts, the choir, the side-aisles, and the chapels. In
short, excepting the arches immediately beneath the northern and
southern towers, which are most probably relics of Odo's cathedral,
the part of the nave, which I first described, is all that is left
above-ground of the semi-circular style; and this is of a very
different character from whatever else I have seen of Norman
architecture. The circular ornaments inserted in the spandrils of
the arches of the choir, possess, as a friend of mine observes,
somewhat of the Moorish, or, perhaps, Tartarian character; being
nearly in the style of the ornaments which are found in the same
situation in the Mogul mosques and tombs, though here they have
much more flow and harmony in the curves. Some are merely in
bas-relief: in others the central circles are deeply perforated,
whilst the ribs are composed of delicate tracery.--<a name="Page_251"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;251]</span></a>There
are so many peculiarities both in the arrangement and in the
details of this cathedral<a name="FNanchor91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>, that it is quite impossible to
convey an adequate idea of them by a verbal description; and I can
only hope that they will be hereafter made familiar to the English
antiquarian by the pencil of Mr. Cotman or Mr. Stothard.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_47"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_47.png" height="409" width="380" alt="Ornaments in the Spandrils of the Arches in Bayeux Cathedral" /></p>

<p>The screen that separates the nave from the choir is Grecian,
and is as much at variance with the inside of such a church, as the
cupola, which is nearly over it, is with the exterior.--Upon
the roof of the choir, are still to be seen the portraits of the
first twenty-one bishops of Bayeux, each with his name inscribed by
his side. The execution of the portraits is very rude, particularly
that of the twelve earliest, whose busts are represented. The
artist has contented himself with exhibiting the heads only, of the
remaining nine. Common tradition refers <a name="Page_252"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;252]</span></a>the whole of these
portraits to the time of Odo; but it is hardly necessary to
observe, that the groined and pointed vaulting is subsequent to his
date.--Bayeux cathedral abounded in works of this description
of art: the walls of the chapels of the choir were covered with
large fresco-paintings, now nearly obliterated.--It is
believed, and with every appearance of probability, that the
Lady-Chapel was erected at a time posterior to the rest of the
building; but there is no certain account of its date. Before the
revolution, it served as a burial-place for some of the bishops of
the see, and for a duke of the noble family of Montemart. Their
tombs ornamented the chapel, which now appears desolate and naked,
retaining no other of its original decorations, than a series of
small paintings, which represent the life of the Holy Virgin, and
are deserving of some attention from the character of expression in
the faces, though the drawing in general is bad. Over the altar is
a picture, in which an angel is pointing out our Savior and the
Virgin to a dying man, whose countenance is admirable.--The
stalls of the choir display a profusion of beautiful oak carving;
and beneath them are sculptured <i>misereres</i>, the first which
we have observed in Normandy.--Very little painted glass is to
be found in any part of the church; but the glazing of the windows
is composed of complicated patterns. This species of ornament was
introduced about the time of Louis XIVth; and Felibien, who has
given several pattern plates in his treatise on architecture,
observes, that it was intended to supply the place of painted
glass, which, as it was then thought, excluded the light.</p>

<p><a name="Page_253"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;253]</span></a></p>
<p>Beneath the choir is a subterraneous chapel dedicated to St.
Maimertus, otherwise called St. Manvieu. Its character is so
similar to that of the crypt at the abbey of the Holy Trinity at
Caen, that there would be little risk in pronouncing it to be part
of Odo's church. It is supported on twelve pillars, disposed in two
rows, the last pillar of each row being imbedded in the wall. The
capitals of the pillars are carved, each with a different design
from the rest. Their sculpture bears a strong resemblance to some
of what is seen in similar situations in the Egyptian temples;
indeed, so strong, that a very able judge tells me he has been led
to suspect that the model might have been introduced by an
anchorite from the desert. Take the following as a specimen.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_20"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_20.png" height="259" width="342" alt="Capital of pillar" /></p>

<p>The walls of the crypt are covered with paintings, probably of
the fifteenth century; but those upon the springing of the arches
above the pillars, appear considerably older. Each spandril
contains an angel, holding <a name="Page_254"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;254]</span></a>a trumpet or other musical
instrument. The outlines of these figures are strongly drawn in
black.--Upon the right-hand side, on entering the chapel, is
the altar-tomb of John de Boissy, who was bishop at the beginning
of the fifteenth century; and, on the opposite side, stands that of
his immediate predecessor, Nicolas de Bosc. Their monuments were
originally ornamented with bas-reliefs and paintings, all which
were mutilated and effaced during the religious wars. De Boissy's
effigy, however, remains, though greatly injured; and the following
epitaph to his memory is preserved in a perfect state, over the
only window that gives light to this crypt. The inscription is
curious, as recording the discovery of the chapel, which had been
forgotten and unknown for centuries.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>This inscription is engraved as prose: verse is very frequently
written in this manner in ancient manuscripts, which custom, as
Joseph Ritson conjectured, arose "from a desire of promoting the
salvation of parchment." I <a name="Page_255"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;255]</span></a>must also add, that the initial
letters are colored red and blue, so that the whole bears a near
resemblance to a manuscript page.</p>

<p>There is another epitaph, engraved in large letters, upon the
exterior of the southern tower, which is an odd specimen of the
spirit of the middle ages. It is supposed to have been placed there
in the twelfth century.</p>

<p>Some authors contend, that the old lady alluded to was the
mistress of one of the Dukes of Normandy: others believe her to
have been the <i>ch&egrave;re amie</i> of Robert, Earl of
Gloucester, illegitimate son to Henry Ist.</p>

<p>Till lately, there was an epitaph within the church, which,
without containing in itself any thing remarkable, strange, or
mysterious, had a legend connected: with it, that supplied the
verger with an inexhaustible fund of entertainment for the curious
and the credulous. The epitaph simply commemorated John Patye,
canon of the prebend of Cambremer, who died in 1540; but upon the
same plate of copper with the inscription, was also engraved the
Virgin, with John Patye at her feet, kneeling, and apparently in
the act of reading from a book placed on a fald-stool. Behind the
priest stood St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the prebend,
having one hand upon his votary's neck, while with the other he
pointed to a lamb.--In all this, there was still nothing
remarkable: unfortunately, however, the artist, wishing perhaps <a
name="Page_256"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;256]</span></a>to
add importance to the saint, had represented him of gigantic
stature; and hence originated the story, which continues to the
present day, to frighten the old women, and to amuse the children
of Bayeux.--</p>

<div class="blkquot">
<p>Once upon a time, the wicked canons of the cathedral murdered
their bishop; in consequence of which foul deed, they and their
successors for ever, were enjoined, by way of penance, annually to
send one of their number to Rome, there to chaunt the epistle at
the midnight mass. In the course of revolving centuries, this
vexatious duty fell to the turn of the canon of Cambremer, who, to
the surprise of the community, testified neither anxiety nor haste
on the occasion.--Christmas-eve arrived, and the canon was
still in his cell: Christmas-night came, and still he did not stir.
At length, when the mass was actually begun, his brethren, more
uneasy than himself, reproached him with his delay; upon which he
muttered his spell, called up a spirit, mounted him, reached Rome
in the twinkling of an eye, performed his task, and, the service
being ended, he stormed the archives of the Vatican, where he
burned the compulsory act, and then returned by the same conveyance
to Bayeux, which he reached before the mass was completed, and, to
the unspeakable joy of the chapter, announced the happy tidings of
their deliverance.</p>
</div>

<p>So idle and unmeaning is the tale, that I should scarcely have
thought it worth while to have repeated it, but for the Latin
distich, which, as the story goes, was extemporized by the demon,
at the moment when they were flying over the Tuscan sea, and by
which he sought to mislead his rider, and to cause him to end his
journey <a name="Page_257"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;257]</span></a>beneath the deep.--The
sense of the verses is not very perspicuous, but they are
remarkable for reading forwards and backwards the same; and though
to you they may appear a childish waste of intellect, you will, I
am sure, admit them to be ingenious, and they may amuse some of the
younger members of your family:--</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Signa te, signa, temer&egrave; me tangis et angis;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Roma tibi subito motibus ibit amor."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>I must dismiss the canon of Cambremer, by stating, that I am
informed by a friend, that the same story is also found in the
lives of sundry other wizards and sorcerers of the good old
times.</p>

<p>Bayeux cathedral, like the other Neustrian churches, has been
deprived of its sainted relics, and its most precious treasures, in
consequence of the successive spoliations which have been inflicted
upon it by heathen Normans, heretical Calvinists, and philosophical
jacobins. The body of St. Exuperius was carried, in the ninth
century, for safety to Corbeil, and the chapter have never been
able to recover it: that of St. Regnobert was in after times stolen
by the Huguenots. Many are the attempts that have been made to
regain the relics of the first bishop of the see; but the town of
Corbeil retained possession, whilst the Bajocessians attempted to
console themselves by antithetical piety.--"Referamus Deo
gratias, nec inde aliquid nos minus habere credamus, qu&ograve;d
Corbeliensis civitas pignus sacri corporis vindicavit. Teneant illi
tabernaculum beat&aelig; anim&aelig; in cineribus suis; nos ipsam
teneamus animam in virtutibus suis: teneant illi ossa, nos merita:
apud illos videatur remansisse quod <a name="Page_258"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;258]</span></a>terr&aelig; est, nos studeamus
habere quod coeli est: amplectantur illi quod sepulchre, nos quod
Paradiso continetur. Meminerit et beatior ille vir, utrique quidem
loco, sed huic speciali se jure deberi."--St. Regnobert's
<i>chasuble</i> is however, left to the church, together with his
maniple and his stole, all of them articles of costly and elaborate
workmanship. They were found in his coffin, when it was opened by
the Calvinists; and they are now worn by the bishop, on the
anniversary of the saint, as well as on five other high festivals,
during the year; at which times, the faithful press with great
devotion to kiss them. When not in use, they are kept in an ivory
chest, magnificently embossed with solid silver, and bearing an
inscription in the Cufic character, purporting that whatever honor
men may have given to God, they cannot honor him so much as He
deserves. Father Tournemine, the Jesuit, is of opinion, that this
box was taken by the French troops, under Charles Martel, in their
pillage of the Saracen camp, at the time of the memorable defeat of
the infidels; and that it was afterwards presented to Charles the
Bald, whose queen, Hermentrude, devoted it to the pious purpose of
holding the relics of Regnobert, in gratitude for a cure which the
monarch had received through the intercession of the saint. But
this is merely a conjecture, and it is not improbable but that the
chest may have been brought from Sicily, which abounded with Arabic
artificers, at the time when it was occupied by the Normans.</p>

<p>St. Regnobert, who was one of the most illustrious bishops of
Bayeux, is placed second on the list, in the <i>History of the
Diocese</i>; but in the <i>Gallia Christiana</i> <a name="Page_259"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;259]</span></a>he
stands twelfth in order. It was customary before the revolution,
and it possibly may be so at present, for the inhabitants of the
city, upon the twenty-fourth of October, the anniversary of his
feast, to bring their domestic animals in solemn procession to the
church, there to receive the episcopal benediction, in the same
manner as is practised by the Romans with their horses, on the
feast of St. Anthony.--St. Lupus, the fourth bishop, and St.
Lascivus, the tenth, are remarkable for their names. St. Lupus is
said to have been so called from his having destroyed the wolves in
the vicinity of Bayeux<a name="FNanchor92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>; and the other is reported to
have been descended from the same person, whom Ausonius addresses
in the following stanza, which has likewise been applied to this
bishop.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Iste <i>Lascivus</i> patiens vocari,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Nomen indignum probitate vitae</p>

<p>&nbsp;Abnuit nunquam; quia gratum ad aures</p>

<p>&nbsp;Esset amicas."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>But neither among her ancient nor her modern prelates can Bayeux
boast of a name equally distinguished as that of Odo. Many were
unquestionably the misdeeds of this great man, and many were
probably his crimes, but no one who wore the episcopal mitre, ever
deserved better of the see. As a statesman, Odo bore a <a name="Page_260"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;260]</span></a>leading
part in all the principal transactions of the times: as a soldier,
he accompanied the Conqueror to England, fought by his side at
Hastings, and by his eloquence and his valor, contributed greatly
to the success of that memorable day. Nor was William tardy in
acknowledging the merits of his brother; for no sooner did he find
himself seated firmly on the throne, than he rewarded Odo with the
earldom of Kent, and appointed him his viceroy in England, whilst
he himself crossed the channel, to superintend his affairs in
Normandy. But the mind which was proof against difficulties,
yielded, as too commonly happens, to prosperity. Nothing less than
the papacy could satisfy the ambition of Odo: he abused the power
with which he was invested in a flagrant manner; and William,
finally, disgusted with his proceedings, arrested him with his own
hand, and committed him prisoner to the old palace at Rouen, where
he continued till the death of the monarch.--The sequel of the
story is of the same complexion: more plots, attended now with
success, and now with disgrace; till at length the prelate resolved
to expiate his sins by a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and died on
his journey, at Palermo.--Such was Odo in his secular
character: as a churchman, historians unanimously agree that he was
most zealous for the honor of his diocese, indefatigable in
re-building the churches which time or war had destroyed, liberal
in endowments, munificent in presents, and ever anxiously intent
upon procuring a supply of able ministers, establishing regular
discipline, and reforming the morals of the flock committed to his
charge.</p>

<p><a name="Page_261"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;261]</span></a></p>
<p>The Bishop of Bayeux has at all times claimed the distinction of
being regarded the first among the suffragan bishops of the Norman
church. In the absence of the archbishop, he presides at, the
ecclesiastical assemblies and councils. His revenue, before the
revolution, was estimated at one hundred thousand livres: per
annum. The see, in point of antiquity, even contests for the
priority with Rouen. From time immemorial, the chapter has enjoyed
the right of mintage; and they appear to have used it till the year
1577, at which time their coin was so much counterfeited, that they
were induced to recal it by public proclamation. Their money, which
was of the size of a piece of two sous, was stamped, on one side,
with a two-headed eagle, and the legend <i>moneta capituli</i>; and
on the obverse, with the letter V, surrounded by the word
<i>Bajocensis</i>. The eagle was probably adopted, in allusion to
the arms of the see, which were, <i>gules</i>; an eagle displayed
with two heads, <i>or</i><a name="FNanchor93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>.--Another privilege of the
chapter was, that no person of illegitimate birth could be allowed
to hold place in it, under any pretext or dispensation
whatever.--Among their peculiar customs, they imitated that of
the see of Rouen, in the annual election of a boy-bishop upon
Innocents'-day; a practice prevalent in many churches in Spain and
Germany, and notoriously in England at Salisbury. The young <a
name="Page_262"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;262]</span></a>chorister took the crozier in
his hands, during the first vespers, at the verse in the
<i>Magnificat</i>, "He has put down the mighty from their seats,
and has exalted the humble and meek;" and he resigned his dignity
at the same verse in the second vespers.--The ceremony was
abolished in 1482.</p>

<h4>CHURCH AND CASTLE OF
CREULLY--FALAISE--CASTLE--CHURCHES-FAIR OF
GUIBRAY.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Falaise, August</i>, 1818.)</p>

<p>Previously to quitting Bayeux, we paid our respects to M.
Pluquet, a diligent antiquary, who has been for some time past
engaged in writing a history of the city. His collections for this
purpose are extensive, and the number of curious books which he
possesses is very considerable. Amongst those which he shewed to
us, the works relating to Normandy constituted an important
portion. His manuscript missals are numerous and valuable. I was
also much pleased by the inspection of an old copy of Aristophanes,
which had formerly belonged to Rabelais, and bore upon its
title-page the mark of his ownership, in the hand-writing of the
witty, though profligate, satirist himself. M. Pluquet's kindness
allowed me to make the tracing of the signature, which I send
you.--</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="picture_21"><br/>
</a><img src="images/picture_21.png" height="132" width="631" alt="Rabelais hand-writing" /></p>

<p>Such an addition as we here find to Rabelais' name, denoting
that the owner of a book considered it as being the property of his
friends conjointly with himself, is not of uncommon occurrence. Our
friend, Mr. Dibdin, who had been here shortly before us, and had
carried <a name="Page_264"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;264]</span></a>off, as we were told, some
works of great rarity from this collection, has enumerated more
than one instance of the kind in his <i>Bibliographical
Decameron</i>; and the valuable library of my excellent friend, Mr.
Sparrow, of Worlingham, contains an Erasmus, which was the property
of Sir Thomas Wotton, and bears, stamped upon its covers, <i>Thomae
Wotton et amicorum</i>.</p>

<p>From Bayeux we returned to Caen, by way of Creully, passing
along bad roads, through an open, uninteresting country, almost
wholly cropped with buck-wheat.--The barony of Creully was
erected by Henry Ist, in favor of his natural son, the Earl of
Gloucester: it was afterwards held by different noble families, and
continued to be so till the time of the revolution. At that period,
it gave a title to a branch of the line of Montmorenci, whose
emigration caused the domain to be confiscated, and sold as
national property; but the baronial castle is still standing, and
displays, in two of its towers and in a chimney of unusual form, a
portion of its ancient character: the rest of the building is
modernized into a spruce, comfortable residence, and is at this
time occupied by a countryman of our own, General Hodgson.</p>

<p>The church at Creully is one of the most curious we have seen.
The nave, side-aisles, and choir, are all purely Norman, except at
the extremities. The piers are very massy; the arches wide and low;
the capitals covered with rude, but most remarkable sculpture,
which is varied on every pillar. Round the arches of the nave runs
a band of the chevron ornament; and over them is a row of lancet
windows, devoid of ornament, and sunk in a wall of extraordinary
thickness. Externally, all is modernized.</p>

<p><a name="Page_265"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;265]</span></a></p>
<p>The view of Caen, on entering from this direction, is still more
advantageous than that on the approach from Lisieux. Time would not
allow of our making any stop at the town on our return: we
therefore proceeded immediately to Falaise, passing again through
an open and monotonous country, which, thoughtfully cultivated, has
a most dreary aspect from the scantiness of its population. We saw,
indeed, as we went along, distant villages, thinly scattered, in
the landscape, but no other traces of habitations; and we proceeded
upwards of five leagues on our way, before we arrived at a single
house by the road-side.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_48"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_48.png" height="378" width="507" alt="Castle of Falaise" /></p>

<p>Falaise appeared but the more beautiful, from the impression
which the desolate scenery of the previous country had left upon
our minds. The contrast was almost equally pleasing and equally
striking, as when, in travelling through Derbyshire, after having
passed a tract of dreary moors, that seems to lengthen as you go,
you suddenly descend into the lovely vallies of Matlock or of
Dovedale. Not that the vale of Falaise may compete with those of
Derbyshire, for picturesque beauty or bold romantic character; but
it has features exclusively its own; and its deficiency in natural
advantages is in some measure compensated, by the accessories
bestowed by art. The valley is fertile and well wooded: the town
itself, embosomed within rows of lofty elms, stretches along the
top of a steep rocky ridge, which rises abrupt from the vale below,
presenting an extensive line of buildings, mixed with trees,
flanked towards the east by the venerable remains of the castle of
the Norman Dukes, and at the opposite extremity, <a name="Page_266"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;266]</span></a>by the
church of the suburb of Guibray, planted upon an eminence. Near the
centre stands the principal church of Falaise, that of St. Gervais;
and in front of the whole extends the long line of the town walls,
varied with towers, and approached by a mound across the valley,
which, as at Edinburgh, holds the place of a bridge.</p>

<p>The name <i>Falaise</i>, denotes the position of the town: it is
said to be a word of Celtic origin; but I should rather suppose it
to be derived from the Saxon, and to be a modification of the
German word, <i>fels</i>, a rock, in which conjecture I find I am
borne out by Adelung: <i>falesia</i>, in modern Latinity, and
<i>falaise</i>, in French, signify a rocky shore. Hence, Brito, at
the commencement of his relation of the siege by Philip Augustus,
says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Vicus erat scabrâ circumdatus undique rupe,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Ipsius asperitate loci Fal&aelig;sa vocatus,</p>

<p>&nbsp;Normann&aelig; in medio regionis, cujus in altâ</p>

<p>&nbsp;Turres rupe sedent et m&oelig;nia; sic ut ad illam</p>

<p>&nbsp;Jactus nemo putet aliquos contingere posse."--</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The dungeon of Falaise, one of the proudest relics of Norman
antiquity, is situated on a very bold and lofty rock, broken into
fantastic and singular masses, and covered with luxuriant
vegetation. The keep which towers above it is of excellent masonry:
the stones are accurately squared, and put together with great
neatness, and the joints are small; and the arches are turned
clearly and distinctly, with the key-stone or wedge accurately
placed in all of them. Some parts of the wall, towards the interior
ballium, are not built of squared free-stone; but of the dark stone
of the country, disposed in a zigzag, <a name="Page_267"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;267]</span></a>or as it is more commonly
called, in a herring-bone direction, with a great deal of mortar in
the interstices: the buttresses, or rather piers, are of small
projection, but great width. The upper story, destroyed about forty
years since, was of a different style of architecture. According to
an old print, it terminated with a large battlement, and bartizan
towers at the angles. This dungeon was formerly divided into
several apartments; in one of the lower of which was found, about
half a century ago, a very ancient tomb, of good workmanship,
ornamented with a sphynx at each end, but bearing no inscription
whatever. Common report ascribed the coffin to Talbot, who was for
many years governor of the castle; and at length an individual
engraved upon it an epitaph to his honor; but the fraud was
discovered, and the sarcophagus put aside, as of no account. The
second, or principal, story of the keep, now forms a single square
room, about fifty feet wide, lighted by circular-headed windows,
each divided into two by a short and massy central pillar, whose
capital is altogether Norman. On one of the capitals is sculptured
a child leading a lamb, a representation, as it is foolishly said,
of the Conqueror, whom tradition alleges to have been born in the
apartment to which this window belonged: another pillar has an
elegant capital, composed of interlaced bands.</p>

<p>Connected with the dungeon by a stone staircase is a small
apartment, very much dilapidated, but still retaining a portion of
its original facing of Caen stone. It was from the window of this
apartment, as the story commonly goes, that Duke Robert first saw
the beautiful Arlette, drawing water from the streamlet below, and
was enamoured <a name="Page_268"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;268]</span></a>of her charms, and took her to
his bed.--According to another version of the tale, the
earliest interview between the prince and his fair mistress, took
place as Robert was returning from the chace, with his mind full of
anger against the inhabitants of Falaise, for having presumed to
kill the deer which he had commanded should be preserved for his
royal pastime. In this offence the curriers of the town had borne
the principal share, and they were therefore principally marked out
for punishment. But, fortunately for them, Arlette, the daughter of
one Verpray, the most culpable of the number, met the offended Duke
while riding through the street, and with her beauty so fascinated
him, that she not only obtained the pardon of her father and his
associates, but became his mistress, and continued so as long as he
lived. From her, if we may give credence to the old chroniclers, is
derived our English word, <i>harlot</i>. The fruit of their union
was William the Conqueror, whose illegitimate birth, and the low
extraction of his mother, served on more than one occasion as a
pretext for conspiracies against his throne, and were frequently
the subject of personal mortification to himself.--The walls
in this part of the castle are from eight to nine feet thick. A
portion of them has been hollowed out, so as to form a couple of
small rooms. The old door-way of the keep is at the angle; the
returns are reeded, ending in a square impost; the arch above is
destroyed.</p>

<p>Talbot's tower, thus called for having been built by that
general, in 1430 and the two subsequent years, is connected with
the keep by means, of a long passage with lancet windows, that
widen greatly inwards. It is more <a name="Page_269"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;269]</span></a>than one hundred feet high, and
is a beautiful piece of masonry, as perfect, apparently, as on the
day when it was erected, and as firm as the rock on which it
stands. This tower is ascended by a staircase concealed within the
substance of the walls, whose thickness is full fifteen feet
towards the base, and does not decrease more than three feet near
the summit. Another aperture in them serves for a well, which thus
communicates with every apartment in the tower. Most of the arches
in this tower have circular heads: the windows are
square.--The walls and towers which encircle the keep are of
much later date; the principal gate-way is pointed. Immediately on
entering, is seen the very ancient chapel, dedicated to St. Priscus
or, as he is called in French, St. Prix. The east end with three
circular-headed windows retains its original lines: the masonry is
firm and good. Fantastic corbels surround the summit of the lateral
walls. Within, a semi-circular arch resting upon short pillars with
sculptured capitals, divides the choir from the nave. In other
respects the building has been much altered.--Henry Vth
repaired it in 1418, and it has been since dilapidated and
restored.--A pile of buildings beyond, wholly modern in the
exterior, is now inhabited as a seminary or college. There are some
circular arches within, which shew that these buildings belonged to
the original structure.</p>

<p>Altogether the castle is a noble ruin. Though the keep is
destitute of the enrichments of Norwich or Castle Rising, it
possesses an impressive character of strength, which is much
increased by the extraordinary freshness of the masonry. The fosses
of the castle; are planted with lofty trees, which shade and
intermingle with the towers and <a name="Page_270"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;270]</span></a>ramparts, and on every side
they groupe themselves with picturesque beauty. It is said that the
municipality intend to <i>restore</i> Talbot's tower and the keep,
by replacing the demolished battlements; but I should hope that no
other repairs may take place, except such as may be necessary for
the preservation of the edifice; and I do not think it needs any,
except the insertion of clamps in the central columns of two of the
windows which are much shattered<a name="FNanchor94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>From the summit we enjoyed a delightful prospect: at our feet
lay the town of Falaise, so full of trees, that it seemed almost to
deserve the character, given by old Fuller to Norwich, of <i>rus in
urbe</i>: the distant country presented an undulating outline,
agreeably diversified with woods and corn-fields, and spotted with
gentlemen's seats; while within a very short distance to the west,
rose another ridgy mass of bare brown rock, known by the name of
Mont Mirat, and still retaining a portion of the intrenchments,
raised by our countrymen when they besieged Falaise, in
1417.--By this eminence the castle is completely commanded,
and it is not easy to understand how the fortress could be a
tenable position; as the garrison who manned the battlements of the
dungeon and Talbot's tower, must have been exposed to the missiles
discharged from the catapults and balistas planted on Mont
Mirat.</p>

<p><a name="Page_271"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;271]</span></a></p>
<p>The history of the castle is inseparably connected with that of
the town: its origin may safely be referred to remote antiquity,
the time, most probably, of the earliest Norman Dukes. If, however,
we could agree with the fanciful author just quoted, it would claim
a much earlier date. The very fact of its having a dungeon-tower,
he maintains to be a proof of its having been erected by Julius
C&aelig;sar inasmuch as the word, <i>dungeon</i>, or, as it is
written in French, <i>donjon</i>, is nothing but a corruption of
<i>Domus Julii</i>! More than once in the course of this
correspondence, I have called your attention to the fancies, or, to
speak in plain terms, the absurdities, of theoretical antiquaries.
The worthy priest, to whom we are indebted for the <i>Recherches
Historiques sur Falaise</i>, "out-herods Herod." Writers of this
description are curious and amusing, let their theories but rest
upon the basis of fair probability. Even when we reject their
reasonings, we are pleased with their ingenuity; and they serve, to
borrow an expression from Horace, "the purpose of a whetstone." But
M. Langevin has nothing farther to offer, than gratuitous assertion
or vague conjecture; and yet, upon the faith of these, he insists
upon our believing, that the foundation of Falaise took place very
shortly after the deluge; that its name is derived from
<i>Fel&eacute;</i>, the cat of Diana, or from the less pure source
of <i>Phaloi-Isis</i>; that the present site of the castle was that
of a temple, dedicated to Belenus and Abraxas; and that every stone
of remarkable form in the neighborhood, was either so shapened by
the Druids, (notwithstanding it is the character of rocks, like
those at Falaise, to assume <a name="Page_272"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;272]</span></a>fantastic figures,) or was at
least appropriated by the Celtic priesthood to typify the sun, or
moon, or stars.</p>

<p>Various tombs, stone-hatchets, &amp;c., have been dug up at
Tassilly, a village within six miles of Falaise, and fragments of
mosaic pavements have been discovered in the immediate vicinity of
the castle<a name="FNanchor95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>; but history and tradition are
alike silent as to the origin of these remains.--The first
historical mention of Falaise is in the year 1027; during the reign
of the fifth Norman Duke, Richard IIIrd, at which period this town
was one of the strong holds of the duchy, and afforded shelter to
Robert, the father of the Conqueror, when he rebelled against his
elder brother. Falaise on that occasion sustained the first of the
nine sieges, by which it has procured celebrity in
history.--Fourteen years only elapsed before it was exposed to
a second, through the perfidy of Toustain de Goz, Count of Hiesmes,
who had been intrusted with the charge of the castle, and who, upon
finding that his own district was ravaged by the forces of the King
of France, voluntarily offered to surrender to that monarch the
fortress under his command, on condition that his territory, the
Hiesmois, should be spared. But Duke William succeeded in retaking
the place of his birth before the traitor had an opportunity of
introducing the troops of his new ally.--In the years 1106 and
1139, Falaise opposed a successful resistance to the armies of
Henry Ist, and of Geoffrey Plantagenet. Upon the first of these
occasions, the Count of Maine, the general of the English forces,
retired with shame from before the <a name="Page_273"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;273]</span></a>walls; and Henry was foiled in
all his attempts to gain possession of the castle, till the battle
of Tinchbray had invested him with the ducal mantle, and had
induced Robert himself to deliver up the fortress in person to his
more fortunate brother. On the second occasion, Robert Marmion,
lord of the neighboring barony of Marmion le Fontenay, a name
equally illustrious in Norman and in English story, held Falaise
for Eustace of Boulogne, son to Stephen, and twice repelled the
attacks of the husband of the Empress Maud.--The fourth siege
was conducted with different success, by Philip Augustus: for seven
days the citizens quietly witnessed the preparations of the French
monarch; and then, either alarmed by the impending conflict, or
disgusted by the conduct of their own sovereign, who had utterly
deserted them, they opened their gates to the enemy.--In 1417
the case was far otherwise, though the result was the same. Henry
Vth attacked Falaise upon the fourth of November, and continued to
cannonade it till the middle of the following February; and, even
then, the surrender was attributed principally to famine. Great
injuries were sustained by the town in the course of this long
siege; but, to the credit of our countrymen, the efforts made
towards the reparation of them were at least proportionate. The
fortifications were carefully restored; the chapel was rebuilt and
endowed afresh; Talbot's tower was added to the keep; and a suite
of apartments, also named after that great captain, was erected in
the castle.--The resistance made by the English garrison of
Falaise in 1450, at the time when we were finally expelled from the
duchy, <a name="Page_274"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;274]</span></a>was far from equal to that
which the French, had previously shewn. Vigour was indeed displayed
in repeated sallies, but six days sufficed to put the French
general in possession of the place. Disheartened troops, cooped up
in a fortress without hope of succour, offer but faint opposition;
and Falaise was then the last place which held out in Normandy,
excepting, only Domfront and Cherbourg, both which were taken
almost immediately afterwards.--Falaise, from this time
forwards, suffered no more from foreign enemies: the future
miseries of the town were inflicted by the hands of its own
countrymen. In common with many other places in France, it was
doomed to learn from hard experience, that "alta sedent civilis
vulnera dextr&aelig;."--Instigated by the Count de Brissac,
governor of the town, and one of the most able generals of the
league, the inhabitants were immoveable in their determination to
resist the introduction of tenets which they regarded as a fatal
variance from the Catholic faith. The troops of Henry IIIrd, in
alliance with those of his more illustrious successor, were vainly
brought against Falaise in 1589, by the Duc de Montpensier; a party
of enthusiastic peasants, called <i>Gautiers</i>, from the name of
a neighboring village, where their association originated, harassed
the assailants unremittingly, and rendered such effectual
assistance to the garrison, that the siege was obliged to be
raised.--But it was only raised to be renewed at the
conclusion of the same year, by Henry of Bourbon, in person, whom
the tragical end of his late ally had placed upon the throne of
France. Brissac had now a different enemy to deal with: <a name="Page_275"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;275]</span></a>he
answered the king's summons to surrender, by pleading his oath
taken upon the holy sacrament to the contrary; and he added that,
if it should ultimately prove necessary for him to enter into any
negotiation, he would at least delay it for six months to come.
"Then, by heavens!" replied Henry, "I will change his months into
days, and grant him absolution;" and; so saying, he commenced a
furious cannonade, which soon caused a breach, and, in seven days,
he carried the town by assault. Brissac, who, on the capture of the
fortress, had retired into the keep, found himself shortly
afterwards obliged to capitulate; and I am sorry to add, that the
terms which he proposed and obtained, were not of a nature to be
honorable to his character. The security of his own life and of
that of seven of his party, was the principal stipulation in the
articles. The rest of the garrison were abandoned to the mercy of
the conqueror, who contented himself with hanging seven of them in
memorial of the seven days of the siege; but, if we may believe the
French historians, always zealous for the honor of their monarchs,
and especially of this monarch, Henry selected the sufferers from
among those, who, for their crimes, had, subjected themselves to
the pain of death.</p>

<p>From these various attacks, but principally from those of 1417
and 1589, the fortifications of Falaise have suffered materially;
and since the last no care has been taken to repair them. The
injuries sustained at that period, and the more fatal, though less
obvious ones, wrought by the silent operation of two centuries of
neglect, have brought the walls and towers to their present state
of dilapidation.</p>

<p><a name="Page_276"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;276]</span></a></p>
<p>The people of Falaise are commonly supposed to be Normans
&kappa;&alpha;&tau; &epsilon;&xi;&omicron;&chi;&eta;&nu; [English.
Not in Original: pre-eminently, especially, above all]; and when a
Norman is introduced upon the French stage, he calls himself a
Falesian, just as any Irishman, in an English farce, is presumed to
come from Tipperary. The town in the French royal calendar is
stated to contain about fourteen thousand inhabitants; but we are
assured that the real number does not exceed nine thousand. Its
staple trade is the manufacture of stockings, coarse caps, and
lace. The streets are wide; and the public fountains, which are
continually playing, impart a freshness, which, at the present
burning season, is particularly agreeable.--The town now
retains only four churches, two within its precincts, and two in
the suburbs. The revolution has deprived it of eight others. Of
those which are now standing, the most ancient is that situated
near the castle, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Langevin
assures us that it was built upon the ruins of the temple of
Fel&eacute;, Isis, Belenus, and the heavenly host of
constellations, and that in the fifth century it changed its
heathen for its Christian patrons. The oldest part (a very small
one it is) of the present structure, appertains to a building which
was consecrated in 1126, by the Archbishop of Rouen, in the
presence of Henry Ist, but which was almost entirely destroyed by
the cannonade in the fifteenth century. An inscription in gothic
letters, near the entrance, relates, that after this desolation, a
beginning was made towards the re-building of the church, "in 1438,
a year of war, and death, and plague, and famine;" but it is
certain that not much of the part now standing can be referred even
to that period. The choir was not completed till the middle of the
<a name="Page_277"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;277]</span></a>sixteenth century, nor the
Lady-Chapel till the beginning of the following one.
Architecturally considered, therefore, the church is a medley of
various styles and ages.</p>

<p>The larger church, that of St. Gervais and St. Protais, is said
to have been originally the ducal chapel, and to stand in the
immediate vicinity of the site of the Conqueror's palace, now
utterly destroyed. According to an ancient manuscript, this church
was consecrated at the same time as that of the Trinity. The
intersecting circular-headed arches of its tower are curious. The
Norman corbel-table and clerestory windows still remain; and the
exterior of the whole edifice promises a gratification to a lover
of architectural antiquity, which the inside is little calculated
to realize.--An invading army ruined the church of the
Trinity; civil discord did the same for that of St. Gervais. The
Huguenots, not content with plundering the treasure, actually set
fire to the building, and well nigh consumed it: hence, the choir
is the work of the year 1580, and the southern wall of the nave is
a more recent construction.</p>

<p>We see Falaise to a great advantage: every inn is crowded; every
shop is decked out; and the streets are full of life and activity;
all in preparation for the fair, which commences in three days, on
the fifteenth of this month, the anniversary of the Assumption of
the Holy Virgin. This fair, which is considered second to no other
in France, excepting that of Beaucaire, is held in the suburbs of
Guibray, and takes its name from the place where it is held. For
the institution, Falaise is indebted to William the Conqueror; and
from it the <a name="Page_278"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;278]</span></a>place derives the greatest
share of its prosperity and importance. During the fourteen days
that the fair continues, the town is filled with the neighboring
gentry, as well as with merchants and tradesmen of every
description, not only from the cities of Normandy, but from Paris
and the distant provinces, and even from foreign countries. The
revolution itself respected the immunities granted to the fair of
Guibray, without, at the same time, having the slightest regard,
either to its royal founder, or its religious origin.--An
image of the Virgin, discovered under-ground by the scratching and
bleating of a lamb, first gave the stamp of sanctity to Guibray.
Miraculous means had been employed for the discovery of this
statue; miraculous powers were sure to be seated in the image.
Pilgrims crowded from all places to witness and to adore; and
hawkers, and pedlars, and, as I have seen inscribed upon a
hand-bill at Paris, "the makers of he-saints and of she-saints,"
found Guibray a place of lucrative resort. Their numbers annually
increased, and thus the fair originated.--We are compelled to
hasten, or we would have stopped to have witnessed the ceremonies,
and joined the festivities on the occasion. Already more than one
field is covered with temporary buildings, each distinguished by a
flag, bearing the name and trade of the occupant; already, too, the
mountebanks and showmen have taken their stand for the amusement of
the company, and the relaxation of the traders; and, what is a
necessary consequence of such assemblages, you cannot stir without
being pestered with crowds of boys, proffering their services to
transport your wares.</p>

<p><a name="Page_279"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;279]</span></a></p>
<p>The church of Guibray, like the others of Falaise, offers
specimens of Norman architecture, strangely altered and half
concealed by modern innovations. In the first syllable of the name
of the place, you will observe the French word for misletoe, and
may thence infer, and probably not without reason, the antiquity of
the station; the latter syllable, albeit in England sheep are not
wont to <i>bray</i>, is supposed by the pious to have reference to
the bleating of the lamb, which led to the discovery of the
miraculous image.--Etymology is a wide district in a pleasant
country, strangely intersected by many and deceitful paths. He that
ventures upon the exploring of it, requires the utmost caution, and
the constant control of sober reason: woe will be sure to betide
the unfortunate wight, who, in such a situation, gives the reins to
fancy, and suffers imagination to usurp the place of judgment,
without reflecting, as has been observed by the poet on a somewhat
similar occasion, that</p>

<h4>ROCK AND CHAPEL OF ST.
ADRIEN--PONT-DE-L'ARCHE--PRIORY OF THE TWO
LOVERS--ABBEY OF
BONPORT--LOUVIERS--GAILLON--VERNON.</h4>

<p class="r">(<i>Mantes, August</i>, 1818)</p>

<p>The last letter which I wrote to you, was dated from Falaise.
Look in the map and you will see that you now receive one from a
point completely opposite. In four days we have passed from one of
the most western towns of the province, to a place situated beyond
its eastern frontier; and in four more, we may almost hope to be
with you again. In this hasty journey we travelled through a
district which has not yet become the subject of description to
you; and though we travelled with less comfort of mind, than in the
early part of our tour, I am yet enabled to send you a few details
respecting it.</p>

<p>From Falaise we went in a direct line to Croissanville: the
road, which we intended to take by St. Pierre sur Dive to Lisieux,
was utterly impracticable for carriages. From Croissanville to
Rouen we almost retraced our former steps: we did not indeed again
make a <i>d&eacute;tour</i> by Bernay; but the straight road from
Lisieux to Brionne is altogether without interest.</p>

<p>There are two ways from Rouen to Paris: the upper, through
Ecouis, Magny, and Pontoise; the lower, by the banks of the Seine.
Having travelled by both of them before, we could appreciate their
respective advantages; and we knew that the only recommendation of
the former <a name="Page_281"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;281]</span></a>was, that it saved some few
miles in distance; while the latter is one of the most beautiful
rides in France, and the towns, through which it passes, are far
from being among the least interesting in Normandy. In such an
alternative, there was no difficulty in fixing our choice, and we
proceeded straight for Pont-de-l'Arche. The chalk cliffs, which
bounded the road on our left, for some distance from Rouen, break
near the small village of Port St. Ouen, into wild forms, and in
one spot project boldly, assuming the shape of distinct towers.
These projections are known by the name of the rock of St. Adrien;
thus called from the patron saint of a romantic chapel, a place of
great sanctity, and of frequent resort with pilgrims, situated
nearly mid-way up the cliff.--The chapel is indeed little more
than an excavation, and is altogether so rude, that its workmanship
affords no clue to discover the date of the building. Its south
side and roof are merely formed of the bare rock. To the north it
is screened by an erection, which, were it not for the windows and
short square steeple, might easily be mistaken for a pent-house.
The western end appears to display some traces of Norman
architecture. The hill, which leads to this chapel, commands a view
of Rouen, the most picturesque, I think, of all that we have seen
of this city, so picturesque from various points. You can scarcely
conceive the eagerness with which we endeavored to catch the last
glimpse, as the prospect gradually vanished from our sight, or the
pleasure with which we still dwell, and shall long continue so to
do, upon the recollection. All round the chapel, the bare chalk is
at this time tinged with a beautiful glow, <a name="Page_282"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;282]</span></a>from the blue flowers of
the <i>Viola Rothomagensis</i>: the <i>Isatis Tinctoria</i>, the
<i>true Woad</i>, is also common on the steep sides of the cliff.
This plant, which is here indigenous, became, during the reign of
Napol&eacute;on, an object of attention with the government, as a
succedaneum for indigo, at the same time that beet-root was
destined to supply the continent with sugar, and salsafy, or
parched wheat, to hold the place of coffee. The restoration of
peace has caused the Isatis to be again neglected; but the
<i>Reseda luteola</i>, or, <i>Dyer's woad</i>, is much cultivated
in the neighborhood, as is the <i>Teasel</i> for the use of the
cloth manufactory.</p>

<p>Pont-de-l'Arche, though now a small mean town, may boast of high
antiquity, if it be rightly believed to be the ancient
<i>Pistae</i>, the seat of the palace erected by Charles the Bald,
in which that sovereign convened councils in the years 861 and 869,
and held assemblies of his nobles in 862 and 864; and from which,
his edicts promulgated in those years, are dated. The same monarch
also built here a magnificent bridge, defended at one extremity by
a citadel upon a small island.--From this there seems every
reason to believe that the town has derived its name; for, in a
diploma issued by our Henry IInd, he calls the place <i>Pontem
Arcis</i>; and its present appellation is nothing but its Latin
name translated into French. The fortress at the head of the bridge
was demolished about thirty years ago, at the time when Millin
published his<a name="FNanchor96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> account of the town. The plate
attached to that account, represents one of the towers as still
standing.--Though deprived of its citadel, <a name="Page_283"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;283]</span></a>Pont-de-l'Arche retains to the
present day its walls, flanked by circular towers; and its bridge,
which is the lowest stone bridge down the Seine, is a noble one of
twenty-two arches, through which the river at a considerable depth
below, rolls with extraordinary rapidity. In the length of this
bridge are some mills, which are turned by the stream; and the
current is moderated under one of the arches, by a lock placed on
the down-stream side, into which barges pass, and so proceed with
security; The bridge, with its mills, forms a very picturesque
object.</p>

<p>At a short distance from the bridge, to the left, looking
towards Paris, is the <i>Colline des deux amans</i>, formerly
surmounted by the priory of the same name. Of the history of the
monastery nothing is known with certainty, nor is even the date of
its foundation ascertained, though it is stated by Millin to be one
of the most ancient in Normandy<a name="FNanchor97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>. But the traditionary tale
connected with this convent, forms the subject of one of the lays
of <i>Mary of France</i>; and it has been elegantly translated by
the late Mr. Ellis, in the introduction to his <i>History of our
Ancient Metrical Romances</i>;--Du Plessis<a name="FNanchor98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> is,
however, of opinion, that the name of the priory is nothing more
than a corruption from the words, <i>deux monts</i>, in allusion to
the twin hills, on one of which it stands; or, if <i>lovers</i>
must have any thing to do with the appellation, he piously suggests
that divine love may have been intended, and that the parties were
no other than our Savior and the Virgin, whose images were placed
over the door of the conventual church.</p>

<p><a name="Page_284"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;284]</span></a></p>
<p>On the opposite side of the bridge of Pont-de-l'Arche, stand the
remains of a far richer abbey, that of Bonport, of the Cistertian
order, founded by Richard Coeur-de-Lion, in 1190, as an <i>ex
voto</i>. The monarch, then just in possession of his crown, was
indulging with his courtiers in the pleasures of the chace, and,
carried away by the natural impetuosity of his temper, had plunged
in pursuit of the deer into the Seine, whose rapid current brought
his life into imminent danger; and he accordingly vowed, if he
escaped with safety, to erect a monastery upon the spot where he
should reach the shore. Hence, according to Le Brasseur<a name="FNanchor99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>, the
foundation, and hence the name. I ought, however, to add, that no
record of the kind is preserved in the <i>Neustrta Pia</i>, nor
even by Millin, who has described and figured such of the monastic
buildings and monuments as had been spared at the early part of the
revolution<a name="FNanchor100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>. Another view of the ruins has
since been published by Langlois, in the first number of a work
which was intended to have comprised a long series of Norman
antiquities, but was discontinued for want of encouragement. The
author, whose portrait I have sent you in the course of this
correspondence, is himself a native of Pont-de-l'Arche, and has
subjoined to his fas-ciculus a couple of plates, illustrative of
the costume and customs of the neighborhood.--In one of these
plates, an itinerant male fortune-teller is satisfying a young
peasant as to the probability of her speedy marriage, by means of a
pack of cards, from which he has turned up the king and queen and
ace of hearts. In the other, <a name="Page_285"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;285]</span></a><i>a cunning woman</i> is
solving a question by a book and key. The poor girl's sweetheart is
an absent soldier, and fears and doubts are naturally entertained
for his safety. To unlock the mysteries of fate, the key is
attached to the mass-book, and suspended from the tip of the finger
of the sybil, who reads the first chapter of the gospel of St.
John; and the invocation is answered by the key turning of <i>its
own accord</i>, when she arrives at the verse beginning, "and the
word was made flesh<a name="FNanchor101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>."--A fine rose-window in
the church of the abbey of Bonport, and two specimens of painted
glass from its windows, the one representing angels holding musical
instruments, supposed to be of the thirteenth century, the other
containing a set of male and female heads of extraordinarily rich
color, probably executed about a century later, are given by
<i>Willemin</i> in his very beautiful <i>Monumens Fran&ccedil;ais
in&eacute;dits</i>. In the same work, you will likewise find two
still more interesting painted windows from Pont-de-l'Arche; some
boatmen and their wives in the Norman costume of the end of the
sixteenth century, and a citizen of the town with his lady, praying
before a fald-stool, bearing the date, 1621.</p>

<p>The church of Pont-de-l'Arche, though greatly dilapidated, is a
building worth notice, in a fine style of the decorated gothic. The
nave is very lofty; the high altar richly carved and gilt; the oak
pulpit embossed with saints; and the font covered with curious,
though not <a name="Page_286"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;286]</span></a>ancient, sculpture. Rich
tracery abounds in the windows, which are also filled with painted
glass, some of it of very good quality. Scripture history and
personages occupy, as usual, the principal part; but in one of the
windows we noticed a representation of the Seine full of islands,
and the town of Pont-de-l'Arche, with a number of persons quitting
it with their horses, baggage, &amp;c. in apparent confusion. So
shattered, however, is the window, that the story is no longer
intelligible in its details; and fragments, quite illegible, are
all that remain of the inscriptions formerly beneath it. It is
probable, that the intention of the artist was to give a picture of
the miseries experienced by the inhabitants at the burning of the
town by our troops under Edward IIIrd.--On the south side of
the church the buttresses are enriched with canopies and other
sculpture; and there was originally a highly-wrought balustrade,
ornamented with figures of children, a part of which
remains.--Pont-de-l'Arche claims the merit of having been the
first town in France, which acknowledged Henry IVth as its lawful
sovereign, after the assassination of his predecessor, in 1589.</p>

<p>On leaving this place, we passed through the forest of the same
name, an extensive tract covered with young trees, principally
beech, oak, and birch. The soil, a mixture of chalk and gravel, is
poor, and offers but little encouragement to the labors of the
plough. All around us, the distant prospect was pleasantly varied
with gentle hills, upon one of which, nearly in front, we soon saw
Louviers, a busy manufacturing town, of about seven thousand
inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in making the fine cloth of
the district, which is considered superior <a name="Page_287"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;287]</span></a>in quality to any other
in France. Spanish wool is almost exclusively used for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Throughout the vicinity of Louviers, are the most undoubted
symptoms of commercial prosperity; new houses every where erecting,
and old ones undergoing improvement. But the streets of the town
itself are, as usual, dirty and narrow, and the people of the lower
orders more than commonly ragged and beggarly. It was impossible to
mistake the nature of their occupations; so many of them had their
faces and hands, and every part of their limbs and bodies that was
visible, died of a bright blue.--The church at Louviers is
very much injured, but very handsome; and though reduced to a nave
with its four aisles it is still a spacious edifice. The south
porch, which projects boldly in the form of a galilee, is scarcely
to be excelled as a specimen of pointed architecture at its highest
pitch of luxuriant beauty. Yet, even in this, the saints have been
torn from their pedestals by the wanton violence of the Calvinists
or democrats. The central tower is square and short: it is,
however, handsome. Two windows, very similar to those of the tower
of St. Romain, in Rouen cathedral, light it on either side; and
saints, placed under canopies, ornament the angles behind the
buttresses.--The great western door is closed, and the front
defaced: the eastern end, likewise, is altogether
modern.--Within, the same kind of architecture prevails as in
the exterior, but the whole is so concealed, and degraded by
ornaments in the worst of taste, and by painted saints in the most
tawdry dresses, that the effect is disgusting. I never saw so great
an array of wretched representations of the heavenly <a name="Page_288"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;288]</span></a>host:
the stone images collected round the holy sepulchre, are even worse
than those at Dieppe. Near the chapel of the sepulchre, however,
are four bas-reliefs, attached to the wall, exhibiting different
events in our Savior's life of good execution, and not in had
taste: an open gallery of fillagree stone-work, under the central
tower on the south side, is an object really deserving of
admiration.</p>

<p>M. Langlois has engraved the gable end of an old house at
Louviers, said to have belonged to the Knights Templars. We found
it used as an engine-maker's shop; and neither within nor without,
could we discover any thing to justify his opinion, that it is a
building of the twelfth or thirteenth century. On the contrary, the
windows, which are double, under a flatly-pointed arch, and are all
of them trefoil-headed, would rather cause it to be considered as
erected two centuries later.</p>

<p>The town of Louviers, though never fortified, is noticed on
several occasions in history. It was the seat of the conferences
between Richard Coeur-de-Lion and Philip Augustus, which ended in
the treaty of 1195, defining new limits to Normandy.--It was,
as I have already mentioned, one of the items of the compensation
made by the same Duke to the Archbishop of Rouen, for the injury
done to the church, by the erection of Château
Gaillard.--During the wars of Edward IIIrd, "Louviers," to use
the language of old Froissart, "after the battle of Caen, was soon
entered by the Englishmen, as it was not closed; and they over-ran,
and spoiled, and robbed it without mercy, and won great riches; for
it was the chief place in all Normandy for drapery, and was full of
merchandize."--And, in the subsequent warfare of the fifteenth
<a name="Page_289"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;289]</span></a>century, this town, like the
others in the duchy, was taken by our countrymen, under Henry Vth,
and lost by them under his successor.--Hither the Norman
parliament retired when the Huguenots were in possession of Rouen;
and here they remained till the recapture of the capital.--It
was probably owing in a great measure to this circumstance, that
Louviers was induced to distinguish itself by a devoted attachment
to the party of the league, for which it suffered severely in 1591,
when it was captured and pillaged by the royalists shortly after
their victory at Ivry. The town was then taken through the
treachery of a priest of the name of Jean de la Tour, who received,
as a recompence, a stall in the cathedral at Evreux, but was so
much an object of abhorrence with his brethren, that he scarcely
ever ventured to appear in his place. During the holy week,
however, he attended; and it once happened, that while he was so
officiating, all the canons contrived to leave the church towards
the close of the psalm, which immediately precedes the
<i>Benedictus</i> at <i>Laudes</i>, so that the anthem, <i>Traditor
autem</i>, which is sung with that hymn, necessarily fell to the
part of de la Tour, who found himself compelled to chaunt it, to
his own extreme confusion, and the infinite amusement of the
congregation. Irritated and mortified, the poor priest preferred
his complaints to the king; but it was one thing to love the
treason, and another to love the traitor; and his appeal obtained
no redress.</p>

<p>From Louviers our next stage was Gaillon, on our road to which
we passed some vineyards, the most northern, I believe, in
Normandy. The vines cultivated in them are all of the small black
cluster grape; and the <a name="Page_290"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;290]</span></a>wine they produce, I am told,
is of very inferior quality,--No place can appear at present
more poverty-stricken than Gaillon; but the case was far otherwise
before the glories of royal and ecclesiastical France were shorn by
the revolution. Ducarel, who visited this town about the year 1760,
dwells with great pleasure upon the magnificence of its palace and
its Carthusian convent and church. Of the palace the remains are
still considerable; and, after having been suffered to lie in a
state of ruin and neglect from an early period in the revolution,
they are now fitting up as a prison. The long inscription formerly
over the gate might with great propriety be replaced by the
hacknied phrase, "Sic transit gloria mundi;" for the vicissitudes
of the fortune of noble buildings are strikingly illustrated by the
changes experienced by this sumptuous edifice, long proverbial
throughput France for its splendor.</p>

<p>Philip Augustus conferred the lordship of Gaillon upon one of
his captains of the name of Cadoc, as a reward for his activity in
the conquest of Normandy. Louis IXth afterwards, early in the
thirteenth century, ceded the town in perpetuity to the Archbishop
of Rouen. St. Louis here received by way of exchange the
Château of Pinterville, which he bestowed upon William
d'Aubergenville, whose uncle, the Bishop of Evreux, had, while
chancellor of France, done much service to him and to Queen
Blanche, his mother. From that time to the revolution the
archbishops had their country seat at Gaillon, and enjoyed the sole
right of trying civil and criminal causes within the town and its
liberties. Their palace, which was destroyed during the wars of
Henry Vth, <a name="Page_291"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;291]</span></a>in 1423, was rebuilt about a
century afterwards by the munificence of the first cardinal Georges
d'Amboise, one of whose successors in the prelacy, Colbert,
expended, as it is said, more than one hundred thousand livres
towards the embellishment of it.--Another archbishop, the
Cardinal of Bourbon, founded the neighboring monastery, in the year
1571. The conventual church was destroyed by fire, through the
carelessness of some plumbers, shortly after Ducarel visited it;
and with it perished the celebrated monument of one of the counts
of Bourbon Soissons, said to have been a master-piece of
sculpture.</p>

<p>The limits assigned to Normandy by the treaty of Louviers, made
Gaillon a frontier town of the duchy; and here therefore I should
take my leave of you, but that, in the prouder days of its history,
Vernon was likewise swayed by the ducal sceptre. Vernon also seems
peculiarly connected with England, from the noble family of the
same name still flourishing, agreeably to their well-known punning
motto, on your side of the water. This motto is in the highest
degree inapplicable to the present state of the town, whose old and
ruinous appearance looks as if it had known neither improvement nor
repair for centuries. Better things might have been expected from
the situation of Vernon, on the banks of the Seine, in a singularly
beautiful valley, and from its climate, which is reported to be so
extraordinarily healthy, that instances of individuals attaining in
it the age of one hundred are not unfrequent.</p>

<p>The royal palace, formerly here, is now wholly swept away; and
of the ancient fortifications there remains little <a name="Page_292"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;292]</span></a>more
than a tower, remarkable for the height and thickness of its walls,
a part of the castle, which, in the reign of Henry IInd, was held
by the service of sixteen knights for its defence<a name="FNanchor102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>.--Prior to the
revolution, Vernon contained five religious houses, three of them
founded by St. Louis, who is said to have regarded this town with
peculiar favor, and probably on that account assigned it as a
jointure to his queen, an honor which it has received upon more
than one other occasion.</p>

<p>The present parish church of Vernon was collegiate. It was
founded about the year 1052, by William of Vernon, and was endowed
by him, at the time of its dedication, with the property called,
<i>La Couture du Pr&eacute; de Giverny</i>, and with a fourth part
of the forest of Vernon, all which the dean and canons continued to
enjoy till the revolution. This William appears to have been the
first of the family who adopted the surname of Vernon. His son,
Richard, by whom the foundation was formally confirmed, attended
the Conqueror to England, and obtained there considerable grants.
One of their descendants ceded the town in 1190 to the King of
France, accepting in return other lands, according to a treaty
still preserved in the royal library at Paris. The tombs of the
founder, and of his namesake, Sir William de Vernon, constable of
England, who died in 1467, and of many others of the family, among
the rest the stately mausoleum of the Mar&eacute;chal de Belle
Isle, were destroyed <a name="Page_293"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;293]</span></a>during the reign of jacobinism
and terror. The portraits, however, of the Marshal and of the Duc
de Penthi&egrave;vre, both of them very indifferent performances,
were saved, and are now kept in the sacristy. The only monument
left to the church is that of Marie Maignard, whose husband,
Charles Maignard, was Lord of Berni&egrave;res and president of the
parliament of Normandy. She died in 1610. Her effigy in white
marble, praying before a fald-stool, has also been spared.</p>

<p class="ctr"><a name="plate_49"><br/>
</a><img src="images/plate_49.png" height="524" width="314" alt="Elevation of the West Front of La D&eacute;livrande" /></p>

<p>The church itself is a spacious building, consisting of a nave
and two aisles, with chapels beyond, separated by lofty pointed
arches, supported on clustered pillars, to each of which is still
attached a tabernacle; but the statues have been destroyed. The
choir is altogether in a different style of architecture: that
portion of it which immediately surrounds the altar, is early
Norman, and most probably belonged to the original structure. Its
arches vary remarkably in width. The most narrow among them are
more decidedly horseshoe-shaped, than any others which I recollect
to have seen.--The west front, though much mutilated, is still
handsome. It is flanked by two small, very short turrets, richly
ornamented.--The square central tower, capped by a conical
roof, does not even equal the height of the nave, which is greatly
superior to that of the choir.--Upon an eminence in the
immediate vicinity of Vernon, are the remains of a Roman
encampment.</p>

<p>With Vernon we quitted ancient Normandy: our ride thence to
Mantes has been delightful; and this town, for the excellence of
its buildings, for neatness, and for a general air of comfort, far
excels any other which we have seen in the north of France. The
name of Mantes <a name="Page_294"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;294]</span></a>also recals the memory of the
Duc de Sully, and recals that of the Conqueror, whose life fell a
sacrifice to the barbarous outrage of which he was here
guilty.--But, I now lay down my pen, and take my leave of
Normandy, happy, if by my correspondence during this short tour, I
have been able to impart to you a portion of the gratification
which I have myself experienced, while tracing the ancient history,
and surveying the monuments of that wonderful nation, who, issuing
from the frozen regions of the north, here fixed the seat of their
permanent government, became powerful rivals of the sovereigns of
France, saw Sicily and the fairest portion of Italy subject to
their sway, and, at the same time that they possessed themselves of
our own island, by right of conquest, imported amongst us their
customs, their arts, and their institutions, and laid the basis of
that happy constitution, under which, by the blessing of God,
Britain is at this moment the pride and envy of the world!</p>

<p>The printing of this work was just concluded, when the author
was favored with drawings, accompanied with short descriptions, of
the chapel of our <i>Lady of the D&eacute;livrande</i>, near Caen,
and of an ancient font at Magneville, near Valognes. For the former
he is indebted to Mr. Cohen, to whom he has so often in the course
of the work, had occasion to express his obligations; for the
latter, to M. de Gerville, an able antiquary at Valognes. Both
these subjects are of such a nature, that he is peculiarly happy to
be able to add them to his imperfect account of the Antiquities of
Normandy: the whole duchy does not contain a religious building
more celebrated for its sanctity than the chapel; and while ancient
fonts of any description are rare in the province, he doubts if
another is to be found like that of Magneville, ornamented with
sculpture and an inscription.</p>
</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>Some historians suppose, that the country situated between Caen
and the sea, formed at least, a part of the Saxon shore of
Neustria. Amongst the other ancient buildings which are found in
this district, the chapel of Notre Dame de la D&eacute;livrande, to
which the Normans have resorted in pilgrimage during the last eight
hundred years, is, perhaps, the most remarkable.</p>

<p>When the philosophers of the revolution envied the religious
enjoyments of the common man, all pilgrimages were forbidden, and
the road leading to our Lady's Chapel, and which, indeed, is the
only high road in this part of the country, became almost
impassable. <a name="Page_296"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;296]</span></a>Under the Emperor it was
thoroughly repaired, and, as they say, by his especial order; and
since the accession of the present French king, the fathers of the
mission, who lose no favorable opportunity of fostering the spirit
of devotion, have erected roods and tabernacles, at due distances,
all along the way side.</p>

<p>After leaving Caen, the traveller will not fail to linger on the
little hill which he ascends just after passing by the first
crucifix. Hence he enjoys a lovely prospect, such as delighted the
old masters. In the foreground is the lofty cross, standing on a
quadrangular pyramid of steps. The broken hollow path bending
upwards round the base, is always occupied by a grotesque group of
cripples and beldames, in rags and tatters, laughing and whining
and praying. The horizon is bounded by long lines of grey and
purple hills, nearer are fields and pastures, whilst the river
glitters and winds amidst their vivid tints. Nearer still, the city
of Caen extends itself from side to side, terminated at each
extremity by the venerable abbeys of William and Matilda. There are
no traces of work-shops and manufactories, or of their pollution;
but the churches with their towers and spires rise above the houses
in bold architectural masses, and the city assumes a character of
quiet monastic opulence, comforting the eye and the mind.</p>

<p>About four miles farther on from Caen, we reached Cambre, one of
the many seignories which belonged to the very noble family of
Mathan. There was a Serlo de Mathan, who appears as a witness to
one of the Conqueror's charters, and the family is now represented
by the present Marquis, who has recovered <a name="Page_297"><span
class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;297]</span></a>his château, and a
fragment of his domain. Cambre is also the residence of the
Abb&eacute; de la Rue, by whom the Marquis was educated. When they
both took refuge in England, the Abb&eacute; was the only protector
of his pupil, who now returns the honorable obligation. It is well
known that the Abb&eacute; has devoted his life to the
investigation of the antiquities both of Normandy and of the
Anglo-Normans. Possessing in a high degree the acute and critical
spirit of research which distinguished the French archaiologists of
the Benedictine school, we have only to regret, that the greater
part of his works yet remain in manuscript. His <i>History of
Anglo-Norman Poetry</i>, which is quite ready for the press, would
be an invaluable accession to our literature; but books of this
nature are so little suited to the taste of the French public,
that, as yet, he has not ventured upon its publication. The
collections of the Abb&eacute;, as may be anticipated, are of great
value; they relate almost wholly to the history of the duchy. The
château escaped spoliation. The portraits of the whole line
of the Mathans, from the first founder of the race, in his hauberk,
down to the last Marquis, in his <i>frisure</i>, are in good
preservation; and they are ancient specimens of the sign-post
painting usually found in old galleries. The Marquis has also a
finely-illuminated missal, which belonged to a Dame de Mathan, in
the fourteenth century, and which has been carefully handed down in
the family, from generation to generation.</p>

<p>The church of Douvre, the next village, is rather a picturesque
building. The upper story of the tower has two pointed windows of
the earliest date. A <a name="Page_298"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;298]</span></a>pediment between them rests on
the archivolt on either side. This is frequently seen in buildings
in the circular style. The other stories of the tower, and the west
front of the church are Norman; the east end is in ruins. The
British name of the village may afford ground for much
ethnigraphical and etymological speculation.</p>

<p>Saint Exuperius is said to have founded the Chapel of La
D&eacute;livrande, some time in the first century. The tradition
adds, that the chapel was ruined by the Northmen,--and the
statue of the Virgin, which now commands the veneration of the
faithful, remained buried until the appointed time of
resuscitation, in the reign of Henry Ist, when it was discovered,
in conformity to established usage and precedent in most cases of
miraculous images, by a lamb. Baldwin, Count of the Bessin and
Baron of Douvre, was owner of the flock to which the lamb belonged.
The Virgin would not remain in the parish church of Douvre, in
which she was lodged by the Baron, but she returned every night to
the spot where she was disinterred. Baldwin therefore understood
that it was his duty to erect a chapel for her reception, and he
accordingly built that which is now standing, and made a donation
of the edifice to the Bishop of Bayeux, whose successor receives
the mass-pennies and oblations at this very day. Some idea of the
architecture of the building may be formed from the inclosed sketch
of the western front. During the morning mass, the chapel was
crowded with women, young and old, who were singing the litany of
the Virgin in a low and plantive tone. A hymn of praise was also <a
name="Page_299"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;299]</span></a>chaunted. It was composed by
the learned Bishop Huet, and it is inscribed upon a black marble
tablet, which was placed in the chapel by his direction. The
country women of the Saxon shore possess a very peculiar
physiognomy, denoting that the race is unmixed. The Norman-Saxon
damsel is full and well made, her complexion is very fair, she has
light hair, long eyelashes, and tranquil placid features; her
countenance has an air of sullen pouting tenderness, such as we
often find in the women represented in the sculptures and paintings
of the middle ages. And all the girls are so much alike, that it
might have been supposed that they all were sisters. As to our
Lady, she is gaily attired in a Cashemire shawl, and completely
covered with glaring amber necklaces and beads, and ribband knots,
and artificial flowers. Many votive offerings are affixed round her
shrine. The pilgrim is particularly desired to notice a pair of
crutches, which testify the cure of their former owner, who lately
hobbled to the Virgin from Falaise, as a helpless cripple, and who
quitted her in perfect health. Of course the Virgin has operated
all the usual standard miracles, including one which may be
suspected to be rather a work of supererogation, that of restoring
speech to a matron who had lost her tongue, which had been cut out
by her jealous husband. Miracles of every kind are very frequently
performed, yet, if the truth must be told, they are worked, as it
were, by deputy, for the real original Virgin suffered so much
during the revolution, that it has been thought advisable to keep
her in the sacristy, and the statue now seen is a restoration of
recent workmanship. In order to conciliate the sailors <a name="Page_300"><span class="pagenum">[Page&nbsp;300]</span></a>and
fishermen of the coast, the Virgin has entered into partnership
with St. Nicholas, whose image is impressed on the reverse of the
medal representing her, and which is sold to the pilgrims.</p>

<p>The country about La D&eacute;livrande is flat, but
industriously cultivated and thickly peopled. The villages are
numerous and substantial. From a point at the extremity of the
green lane which leads onward from La D&eacute;livrande, six or
eight church spires may be counted, all within a league's distance.
By the advice of the Abb&eacute; de la Rue, we proceeded to
Bernieres, which is close to the sea. The mayor of the commune
offered his services with great civility, and accompanied us to the
church, which, as he told us, was built by Duke William. We easily
gave credit to the mayor's assertion, as the interior of the nave
is good Norman. The pillars which support the groining of the roof
are square; this feature is rather singular. The tower and spire
are copied from Saint Peter, at Caen. Those of Luc, Courseilles,
Langrune, and the other neighboring villages, are upon the same
model. Many instances of the same kind of affiliation occur at
home, which shew how easily a fashion was set in ecclesiastical
architecture.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The most remarkable among the ancient inscriptions found in that
part of Normandy, which is now comprised in the Department of La
Manche, are upon an ancient altar, at Ham, on a medallion attached
to the outside of the church of Ste. Croix, at St. L&ocirc;, and
upon the font at Magneville, near Valognes. The first of these has
generally been referred to the seventh century; the second seems to
be of the ninth; and the last may with safety be considered as of
the latter part of the tenth, or beginning of the eleventh, at
which period, the choir of the church of Magneville appears also to
have been erected. Of the sculpture upon the font, as well as of
the inscription, an accurate idea may be formed, from the annexed
drawing: the most remarkable character of the inscription seems to
be in its punctuation. The letters upon the altar, at Ham, touch
one another, and there is no separation of any kind between the
words: here, on the contrary, almost all the words are divided by
three or four points placed in a perpendicular direction, except at
the end of the phrases, where stops are wholly wanting. At Ham,
also, the letters are cut into the stone, while at Magneville they
are drawn with a brush, with a kind of black pigment.</p>
